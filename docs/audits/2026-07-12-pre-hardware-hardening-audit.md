# Pre-hardware hardening audit — w17-ground-station

**Status: working document for the 2026-07 pre-hardware hardening pass. Uncommitted
until user review. Updated after every completed batch.**

| | |
|---|---|
| Repository / branch | `w17-ground-station` / `main` |
| Commit audited | `cf038c2` ("docs: add adapter and simulation bench checks") |
| Original audit date | 2026-07-12 (same session, morning) |
| Revalidation date | 2026-07-12 (afternoon) — working tree byte-identical to `cf038c2`, `git status` clean |
| Tests before implementation | `npm test` → **263/263 green** (24 files), re-run at revalidation: 263/263 |
| Original executive verdict | **Ready with minor pre-bench corrections** — architecture coherent, safety boundaries real and structurally enforced, B1–B8 matches plan; one HIGH defect (Mobile Hotspot PS) + two MEDIUM defects (global key handlers, multi-adapter status) invisible to tests/sim by construction |

Hard boundaries in force for the entire pass (from `CLAUDE.md` + user instructions):
W3/5602 stays LOG-ONLY; `noControlPath.test.js` stays green and may only be
strengthened; no pan/tilt or camera-control mapping; no car-control path; no CRSF
encoder; `docs/windows_bridge_contract.md` §1–§7 untouchable; canonical contract
authority is iPhone-side; ground station remains viewer/setup/launcher only; simulation
never counts as hardware evidence; persisted mode values stay compatible; no error
concealment behind optimistic fallbacks; nothing committed/pushed without user review.

---

## 1. Original findings (complete, with evidence) + revalidation

Revalidation legend: **STILL PRESENT** / ALREADY FIXED / PARTIALLY FIXED / N/A /
REQUIRES HARDWARE / REQUIRES USER DECISION. Since the tree is unchanged from
`cf038c2`, every finding revalidates as originally reported; the column records the
*actionability* split.

### HIGH

**H1 — Mobile Hotspot PowerShell script very likely broken on stock Windows PowerShell 5.1.**
- Evidence: `main/hotspot.js:24-48` (`PS_AWAIT_HELPER`, `PS_START`, `PS_STOP`). Two independent problems:
  1. `Await` reflects over `[System.WindowsRuntimeSystemExtensions]` but the script never runs
     `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime`; in a fresh `-NoProfile`
     PowerShell 5.1 process that assembly is not loaded → type lookup fails at runtime.
     (Every canonical WinRT-tethering snippet includes the `Add-Type` line.)
  2. `ConfigureAccessPointAsync()` returns `IAsyncAction` (documented WinRT signature), not
     `IAsyncOperation`1`; `Await` only finds the `IAsyncOperation`1` overload of `AsTask`,
     so the configure call throws even with the assembly loaded. Canonical snippets carry a
     separate `AwaitAction` for exactly this reason.
- Failure mode: PowerShell default error handling continues past failed statements;
  `$manager.StartTetheringAsync()` is still *invoked* (arguments evaluate before `Await`
  fails) → **tethering can start with the OLD Windows-configured SSID/password, not
  W17-GRID**, while the script prints `START_` without `Success` → app reports mobile
  backend failed → falls back to `hostednetwork` (unsupported on most post-2018 drivers)
  → error shown. Operator sees "failed"; hotspot silently on with wrong credentials.
- Why tests can't catch it: `test/hotspot.test.js` and `main/wifiSim.js` fake the `run`
  seam and canned-return `TETHER_OK`/`START_Success`; the script text never executes.
- Confidence: inferred with high confidence from documented API signatures + PS 5.1
  semantics; final proof is bench-only.
- Original recommendation: fix before bench — `Add-Type`, `AwaitAction` helper (or poll
  `GetCurrentAccessPointConfiguration` instead of awaiting), `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'`
  + try/catch so partial execution can never half-start tethering.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT at revalidation → CODE-FIXED in Batch A1** (true WinRT
  behavior still REQUIRES HARDWARE — validate with `scripts/hotspot-diag.js` +
  checklist §3). See A1 completion notes and the transfer checkpoint below.
- Batch: **A1 — DONE (code), bench-pending**.

### MEDIUM

**M1 — Global keyboard handlers fight every text input in the setup flow.**
- Evidence: `renderer/hud.js:63-66` — window-level `keydown` calls `e.preventDefault()`
  on arrows and **space** unconditionally, including with a text field focused.
  `renderer/setupFlow.js:71-73` — window-level Enter clicks NEXT whenever gate+nav are
  visible, regardless of focus.
- Impact: cannot type spaces into SSID/passwords (silently dropped); arrows don't move
  the caret in IP/ELRS-path/COM fields; Enter after typing a Wi-Fi password *navigates to
  SEAT FIT* instead of joining, discarding the join. Real WPA2 passphrases contain spaces.
- Confirmed by code reading. Pre-existing HUD-era handlers that became a conflict when
  setup-flow inputs landed (`34a1446`); not a B1–B8 regression.
- Original recommendation: scope both handlers away from
  `input/select/textarea/contenteditable`; Enter in the password field triggers JOIN.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → FIXED in Batch A2.** Both global handlers now go
  through `shared/keyboardFocus.mjs` (pure focus policy): editable targets
  (input/select/textarea/contenteditable incl. nested) are never recorded/prevented;
  Enter advances only from a non-interactive focus; Enter in `netPassword` invokes JOIN.
  DOM-level tests (jsdom) pin the behavior end-to-end. Batch: **A2 — DONE**.

**M2 — Multi-adapter `status()` ambiguous; join verification adapter-order-dependent.**
- Evidence: `shared/wifiParse.js:60-73` — `parseNetshInterfaces` scans *all* interface
  blocks as one: last SSID wins, first percentage wins (fields from different adapters
  mixed). `main/wifiManager.js:113-121` — `join()` verifies success by polling this
  unpinned merged status (`status.ssid === ssid`).
- Impact: with built-in on the camera/home network and RT5370 joining W17-GRID (the
  supported topology, `docs/SETUP.md` §6), join-success detection depends on netsh
  enumeration order; a *successful* dongle join can report "not connected after 20s".
  Signal % can belong to the other adapter.
- Confirmed logic defect; whether it bites depends on enumeration order (coin-flip).
- Original recommendation: verify joins against the *pinned* interface via
  `parseNetshInterfacesList` (already per-adapter), or pass `iface` into `status()`.
  Add reversed-order two-adapter fixtures.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → FIXED in Batch A3.** The merged parser
  `parseNetshInterfaces` is DELETED; `status({iface})` selects one block from the
  per-adapter `parseNetshInterfacesList` (all connection fields from the same block;
  missing adapter = explicit `present:false` result; netsh failure = `ok:false` with
  reason, no longer silent "not connected"); `join({iface})` verifies against the
  pinned block only, with honest last-poll timeout errors. Reversed-order,
  both-connected, German, and transitional fixtures added; both block orders proven
  to give the same pinned result. Real netsh behavior REQUIRES HARDWARE (bench).
  Batch: **A3 — DONE (code), bench-pending**.

**M3 — UI can start a hotspot but never stop it; quit leaves it running.**
- Evidence: `hotspotStop` exists in `main/preload.cjs:25` + `main/main.js:173` but no
  renderer code calls it (grep-confirmed); `app.on('will-quit')` (`main/main.js:261-265`)
  stops headtracking/runtime/mediamtx but not the hotspot.
- Impact: machine keeps broadcasting W17-GRID after the session; hostednetwork keeps the
  RT5370 claimed; recovery is manual OS settings. Hidden state confuses the next session.
- Confirmed (dead IPC surface). Stop-on-quit may be deliberate (don't kill the phone's
  network mid-session) — but the stop *button* is missing regardless.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT — REQUIRES USER DECISION** (quit policy). STOP button +
  lifecycle states proposed for approval. **→ FIXED in B1** (Q1/Q2 approved): full
  INACTIVE→STARTING→LIVE→STOPPING lifecycle authority in the main process
  (`main/hotspotLifecycle.js`), STOP HOTSPOT beside START in PIT WALL, and a quit-policy
  dialog (`main/quitPolicy.js`) that never leaves an app-owned hotspot running without
  asking. Batch: **B1 — DONE (code), WinRT behavior bench-pending**.

### LOW

**L1 — Elevation detection is English-only.**
- Evidence: `main/hotspot.js:133` — `/denied|elevat|administrator/` against localized
  netsh output; on non-English Windows the "run as administrator" guidance degrades to a
  raw error. Rest of repo parses locale-structurally; this line doesn't.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → FIXED in B2.** The English-keyword regex is deleted; a
  hostednetwork start failure is now classified generically (`kind:'start-failed'`,
  `backend:'hosted'`) in every locale, and the administrator hint is a SUGGESTION driven
  by a locale-neutral elevation FACT (a `WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole` PowerShell token,
  `ELEV_ADMIN`/`ELEV_LIMITED`), never by matching localized prose. EN and DE fixtures
  classify identically. Real localized-Windows behavior REQUIRES HARDWARE. Batch:
  **B2 — DONE (code), bench-pending**.

**L2 — Unknown *open* networks can't be joined.**
- Evidence: `main/wifiManager.js:90-123` — no-password path skips profile creation and
  `netsh wlan connect name=X` fails when no profile exists; the password path builds a
  WPA2-PSK profile only (`shared/wifiParse.js:160-183`). An unknown open network fails
  with a raw netsh error. WPA3-SAE-only networks also unsupported (WPA2 profile).
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → FIXED in B3** (decision Q3). A normalized `security`
  model (`classifyWifiSecurity`) drives the flow: NEW and SAVED **open** networks join
  (open profile installed when there is no saved one; no password, no credential
  persisted), with an `OPEN NETWORK — unencrypted` warning; **WPA3-only** and
  **enterprise** are rejected BEFORE any OS call with stable kinds + controlled messages
  (never a raw netsh error); WPA2-PSK and transition (WPA2-compatible) are unchanged;
  empty/whitespace/malformed SSIDs are dropped. Real netsh open/WPA3 behavior REQUIRES
  HARDWARE. Batch: **B3 — DONE (code), bench-pending**.

**L3 — `videoPlaying` can go stale-true.**
- Evidence: `renderer/hud.js:323-324` — set on `'playing'`, cleared only on `'emptied'`;
  a dying stream fires `waiting`/`stalled`, not `emptied` → GRID VIDEO LOCK (and W2
  `video_lock`) stays green between stream death and WHEP reconnect.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → FIXED in C1.** A pure state model
  (`shared/videoState.mjs`) over the media events + WHEP transport signals makes `playing` the
  only confident-green state; `waiting`/`stalled`/transport-`dropped`/`error` all clear it, so a
  frozen/reconnecting stream reports `video_lock:false`. GRID, HUD, and W2 read one authority.
  Real WebRTC-drop behavior REQUIRES HARDWARE (camera → WHEP). Batch: **C1 — DONE (code),
  bench-pending**.

**L4 — Windows `ping` exit-code semantics can false-green IPHONE REACHABLE.**
- Evidence: `main/hostProbe.js:22-31` — exit 0 ⇒ reachable; Windows ping returns 0 for
  router-originated "Destination host unreachable" replies. Flat hotspot subnet gives
  timeouts (correct red); routed/office networks can false-green.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → FIXED in B4.** `classifyPing` no longer trusts exit code
  alone: a `TTL=` echo reply (locale-neutral) is the only `reachable`; a Windows exit-0
  reply WITHOUT `TTL=` (the router "Destination host unreachable" false-green) is classed
  `unreachable`; outcomes split into reachable/timeout/unreachable/invalid/
  command-unavailable/command-error/unknown, with conservative `unknown` where
  localization prevents certainty. UI wording proves the network path only (decision C4).
  Real Windows ping behavior REQUIRES HARDWARE. Batch: **B4 — DONE (code), bench-pending**.

**L5 — Doc/state drift.**
- Evidence: `../CURRENT_STATUS.md` records `3c16954`/217 tests (HEAD is `cf038c2`/263;
  update known-deferred by user). Bench host clone at `dab3039`, must pull ≥ `cf038c2`.
  `docs/setup_flow_bench_checklist.md` prereqs omit `npm run setup` (mediamtx fetch +
  Electron repair) and the `mediamtx.yml` camera-source edit — literal reading reaches
  §10 ("HUD fades in over live video") with video never possible.
  `docs/iphone_bridge_readiness.md` §4 describes a 400 ms stale timeout + re-arming
  centered gate superseded by the contract (300 ms, no re-arm) — implementation follows
  the contract; readiness doc is stale.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT.** Batch: **F**.

**L6 — Hotspot password persisted in plaintext.**
- Evidence: `renderer/setupFlow.js:173-184` (`leavePitwall` saves `hotspot.password`
  every visit) → `settings.json` under userData. Wi-Fi *join* passwords are NOT persisted
  (only via netsh profile; temp XML deleted). Acceptable for a hobby tool; on disk though.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT — REQUIRES USER DECISION** (storage policy). Never-log
  guarantee is objective and will be enforced regardless. Batch: **E1**.

### DESIGN QUESTIONS (all REQUIRE USER DECISION)

**D1 — Replay telemetry visually indistinguishable from live car data on the HUD.**
`npm run demo` is deliberately "live-looking"; HUD shows LQ/battery with no demo marker
(`mode:"demo"` goes only into the iPhone packet). PIT WALL sim got a "SIMULATED WIFI"
tag for exactly this confusion risk. Options: session-panel REPLAY chip, watermark,
both, status quo. Batch: **C2**.

**D2 — GRID re-applies the session (starting the W2 UDP sender) on *entering* GRID,
before START.** Evidence: `renderer/setupFlow.js:391-409` `enterGrid()` →
`gs.applySession()` → `main/main.js:126-132` starts bridge if iphone-hud + addr.
Reachability check itself is ping-based and does NOT need W2. Effect: telemetry packets
flow to the phone during the checklist. Defensible (phone HUD shows live data while the
operator checks it) but undocumented. Batch: **C5**.

**D3 — Env-locked settings still editable in ⚙.** GRID radio note says "LOCKED BY ENV
VARS" once; the ⚙ telemetry/W3 controls stay enabled and silently lose to env.
Batch: **C3** (presentation choice: disabled + ENV badge showing effective value —
default proposed by auditor, user may veto).

### VERIFICATION GAPS

**V1 — no-control-path guard is an enumerated file list, not a directory sweep.**
- Evidence: `test/noControlPath.test.js:75-121` — hardcoded lists; a NEW `main/` module
  importing `HeadTrackingReceiver` passes CI until someone appends it. Plan relied on
  review discipline. Recommendation: glob `main/`+`shared/`+`renderer/` with explicit
  allowlist (`main.js` only), keeping all existing assertions.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → FIXED in D1.** The two enumerated lists are DELETED; the
  guard now walks `main/`+`shared/`+`renderer/` (symlink-safe, extension-classifying) and
  scans every discovered runtime module — a new file is included automatically. All prior
  semantic assertions are preserved. See the Batch D status section below. Batch: **D1 — DONE**.

**V2 — `main.js` and `renderer/setupFlow.js` have zero test coverage.**
- The two files where defects were found (M1 in untested renderer glue;
  `applyW3`/`w3ConfigFor`/IPC shapes in untested main.js). No Electron boot smoke test
  (CI package-smoke proves packaging, not boot).
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT → PARTIALLY FIXED in A2**: `renderer/setupFlow.js` (+
  `hud.js` key handlers) now run under jsdom in `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` — real
  index.html, real modules, mocked preload surface (the D2 harness, pulled forward).
  `main.js` remains uncovered. Batches: **D2** (extend DOM coverage), **D3** (boot
  smoke, Windows CI job preferred).
- **→ D2 COMPLETE (2026-07-14):** `main.js` decomposed onto dependency-injected seams
  (`main/appWiring.js` + `w3ConfigFor` in `main/headTrackingConfig.js`) that unit-test
  with fakes; IPC/preload/renderer symmetry pinned from all three sides
  (`test/ipcSurface.test.js`); session/config/shutdown integration covered
  (`test/appWiring.test.js`); renderer boot/timer/subscription races covered + two
  orphaned-interval defects FIXED. Remaining: a REAL Electron boot (preload execution,
  live ipcMain, sandbox flags at runtime) = **D3**. Batch: **D2 — DONE**.

**V3 — IPHONE REACHABLE green ≠ HUD can receive UDP 5601.**
- ICMP proves L3 reachability; iOS Local Network permission can still block UDP receive.
  W2 is deliberately one-way, so the app *cannot* know. Checklist §8 partially covers it.
- **Revalidation: STILL PRESENT** (inherent limit — wording fix only). Batch: **C4**.

### Also recorded in the original audit (context, no action or covered above)

- Sim is specified-optimistic (`wifiSim` returns `START_Success` unconditionally) — the
  "sim is never bench evidence" rule is the documented mitigation (README + checklist).
- WPA3-SAE caveat folded into L2/B3. CSP pins connect-src to `127.0.0.1:8889`
  (`W17_WHEP_URL` override footgun — LOW, note only). `netsh` argv quoting for names
  with spaces is believed fine via argv arrays but bench-unverified (D4 adds static
  command-generation tests). PIT WALL entry latency: `wifi:capabilities` awaits a
  PowerShell WinRT probe with 20 s timeout (LOW/UX, see N3).

## 2. New findings discovered at revalidation (not in the original audit)

**N1 — Renderer IPC glue has zero error handling.** `grep catch renderer/setupFlow.js
renderer/hud.js` → no matches. Any IPC rejection (e.g., `settings:set` disk failure,
handler throw) is an unhandled rejection; if `boot()`'s `gs.getSettings()` rejects, the
gate renders blank with no step visible. LOW-MEDIUM robustness. Batch: **D2/A2**
(harden `boot()` + wrap save path minimally; test).
**→ FIXED in A2**: every async IPC call in `renderer/setupFlow.js` and `renderer/hud.js`
is deliberately guarded (narrow, one call per guard; real error logged, fixed
credential-free fallback rendered in the relevant UI region). `boot()` failure renders a
visible SETUP DATA UNAVAILABLE state with RETRY (`#bootError`); save failures warn on the
team radio and never block the flow; join/hotspot/settings-save rejections withhold raw
error detail from the log (their arguments carry credentials). jsdom tests cover all of it.

**N2 — `HotspotManager.stop()` drops ownership before the stop completes.**
`main/hotspot.js:146-156` clears `_activeBackend` before awaiting the command; a failed
stop loses the "we own an active hotspot" state, so retry is impossible. LOW.
**→ FIXED in A1**: `_activeBackend` is now cleared strictly AFTER a successful stop; a
failed stop returns `{ok:false, kind:'stop-failed', backend}` and retains ownership.
Test: `test/hotspot.test.js` "a FAILED stop retains ownership…".

**N3 — PIT WALL entry can block on the hotspot probe.** `enterPitwall()` awaits
`wifi:capabilities` → `hotspot.probeBackends()` (PowerShell WinRT, 20 s timeout) before
showing tabs; on a slow/broken PS the network step appears frozen. LOW/UX.
**→ FIXED in B1/N3**: `wifi:capabilities` no longer probes at all (it answers instantly
with platform + sim flag); the WinRT probe moved to its own non-blocking
`wifi:hotspot-probe` channel through the lifecycle authority (cached, single-flight,
`{refresh:true}` re-probe). PIT WALL renders immediately; the HOTSPOT pane shows
`CHECKING HOTSPOT SUPPORT…` until the probe lands and distinguishes
probing/supported/unsupported/failed/externally-active. Adapter + network UI stay usable
throughout. Batch: **B1/N3 — DONE**.

**N4 — `runCommand` timeout kill doesn't kill the Windows process tree.**
`main/runCommand.js:31-34` `child.kill()` only; a hung PowerShell can orphan WinRT work.
LOW. **→ FIXED in A1**: on win32 the timeout path now runs
`taskkill /pid <pid> /t /f` (falls back to `child.kill()` on taskkill spawn error / off
Windows). Tests: `test/runCommand.test.js` (timeout result shape, cross-platform).

## 3. Priority and batch plan

| Batch | Contents | Gate |

| A2 | M1 keyboard scoping (+ Enter=JOIN, per user instructions), pure focus-helper + tests; minimal N1 hardening of boot/save | objective |
| A3 | M2 adapter-pinned status/join + reversed-order fixtures; adapter-UI discrepancy investigation report (present behavior → questions → proposals; NO redesign without approval) | objective (fix) + decision (UX) |
| B1 | M3 + N2 + N3: STOP HOTSPOT UI lifecycle, stop-state ownership fix; quit policy | **user decision: quit policy** |
| B2 | L1 locale-neutral elevation/error detection + non-English fixtures | objective |

| F | L5 + all doc sync (checklist prereqs, CURRENT_STATUS pointer, readiness-doc stale note, adapter/hotspot/sim/permission docs; contract §1–§7 untouched) | objective |
| G | Wider proposal pass (proposals only, no unapproved implementation) | proposals |

## 4. User decisions (log)

| # | Topic | Decision | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Hotspot quit policy (B1) | **(a) Ask on quit** — dialog ONLY when the app owns an active hotspot; buttons STOP HOTSPOT AND QUIT / LEAVE HOTSPOT RUNNING / CANCEL. Never shown for a hotspot the app did not start. | 2026-07-12 |
| Q2 | STOP HOTSPOT button + lifecycle (B1) | **Approved**: INACTIVE→STARTING→LIVE→STOPPING (+ actionable ERROR); STOP beside START; conflicting actions disabled during transitions; duplicate requests prevented; failed stop retains ownership + allows retry (UI stays LIVE); never stop externally-started hotspots; N2 fixed (`_activeBackend` cleared only after successful stop). | 2026-07-12 |
| Q3 | Wi-Fi network scope (B3) | **(a) Support saved AND new open networks** with an OPEN NETWORK security warning and no password field; WPA3-only rejected with "WPA3-only networks are not currently supported. Use a WPA2 network or start the W17 hotspot."; malformed/empty SSIDs skipped; hidden networks out of scope but must yield a clear unsupported message, never a raw netsh error. Tests: open/WPA2/WPA3-only/malformed/escaping. | 2026-07-12 |
| Q4 | Replay/sim visual treatment (C2) | **(a)** Compact persistent `TELEMETRY · REPLAY` chip in the HUD session panel while replay telemetry is active; not dismissible while replay runs; visible in screenshots; SIMULATED WIFI stays separate; no watermark. | 2026-07-12 |
| Q5 | W2 start timing (C5) | **(a) Keep GRID-entry start, document it**: wording must state W2 begins on GRID entry (iPhone mode + confirmed IP) as preflight evidence; ping proves path only; live phone data is the meaningful evidence; START begins the driving/HUD session. No new preflight packet type. | 2026-07-12 |
| Q6 | Credential storage policy (E1) | **safeStorage/DPAPI encryption, NO persistent-plaintext fallback**: transparent plaintext→encrypted migration; ciphertext everywhere incl. `.bak`; when OS encryption unavailable → keep in memory for session only, do not persist, warn concisely; undecryptable secrets (foreign account/machine) → no crash, clear/ignore secret, re-request password, preserve other settings; credentials never in logs/errors/diagnostics/snapshots/test output; redaction tests required. | 2026-07-12 |
| Q7 | Adapter UX direction (A3) | Likely cause accepted (macOS guide mode w/o sim) but **verify the actual launch path**. Approved direction: ALWAYS show an ADAPTER section in PIT WALL — Win: 0=NO WLAN ADAPTER + troubleshooting + RESCAN; 1=clearly styled selected-adapter card; 2+=obvious dropdown (border/chevron/hover/focus, SELECT/CHANGE ADAPTER wording); saved-missing=show saved name marked NOT DETECTED, require re-choose; show name/description/state/SSID/signal. Guide mode: show section with "Adapter selection is available in the Windows application" + `W17_WIFI_SIM` dev hint; never present host interfaces as usable adapters. Sim: deterministic 0/1/2-adapter scenarios, 2-adapter demonstrates selection. Show revised design before *substantial* visual redesign; objective visibility/error fixes may proceed. | 2026-07-12 |
| Q8 | Env-lock presentation (C3) | **Confirmed**: disabled control + amber ENV tag + effective value shown + tooltip naming the exact env var + explanation that env takes precedence. Disabled controls must stay readable/accessible; where disabled blocks focus/tooltip, use readonly + adjacent lock indicator. | 2026-07-12 |
| C4 | Reachability wording | **Confirmed, shorter UI string**: "Ping succeeded. This proves the network path only. Confirm live data on the iPhone; check iOS Local Network permission if it does not appear." Longer explanation goes to checklist/tooltip. | 2026-07-12 |

Additional execution orders (2026-07-12): address N1 (renderer IPC rejection handling +
visible boot-failure state), N2 (ownership retained after failed stop), N3 (PIT WALL
renders before the WinRT probe completes, visible probing state), N4 (prevent orphaned
PowerShell trees where reasonable). Batch order: A1 → A2 → A3 → B2/B4/C1/C4/D1/D2/D4 →
approved decision-gated work. All changes stay uncommitted; focused + full tests after
every batch.

## 5. Remaining hardware-only verification (after this pass)

Bench host (Windows + admin + RT5370): real netsh scan/join/profile quoting; Mobile
Hotspot WinRT behavior (H1 fix proof) incl. SSID actually broadcast; hostednetwork
fallback + elevation; tasklist detection + elrs survival; ping semantics on the real
network(s); firewall prompts (inbound UDP 5602); localized-Windows behavior if
applicable. Camera: H.264 check, RTSP URL, mediamtx WHEP. Car/ELRS: crsf-serial
telemetry via com0com. iPhone: W2 display, Local Network permission, W3 log-only runbook,
client-isolation negative test. All tracked in `docs/setup_flow_bench_checklist.md`.

**B3/B4 additions:** real `netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid` Authentication/Encryption
values on the bench (confirm the `security` classification for an actual open, WPA3-only,
enterprise, and WPA2/WPA3 transition AP — especially how a real transition AP reports its
Authentication); a real new-open-network join via the installed open profile; and real
Windows `ping` output — confirm a live host shows `TTL=` (→ reachable) and a
router-originated "Destination host unreachable" is classed `unreachable` not a false green,
including on a localized Windows build.

## 6. Change log

- 2026-07-12 — Audit document created at revalidation; tree = `cf038c2`, clean;
  baseline `npm test` 263/263. No code changes yet.
- 2026-07-12 — Q1–Q8 + C4 decisions recorded (§4).
- 2026-07-12 — **Batch A1 complete (code)**: H1 hotspot PowerShell rewrite (fail-closed,
  structured `kind` results, both awaiters), N2 ownership-after-success, N4 Windows
  tree-kill, sim token vocabulary updated, `test/hotspot.test.js` rewritten (10→23), new
  `test/runCommand.test.js` (4), new `scripts/hotspot-diag.js` bench tool. Focused tests

  matched this checkpoint byte-for-byte (same `git status`, HEAD `cf038c2`); skeptical
  re-review found no interrupted-edit debris, duplicate declarations, unreachable
  branches, token collisions, unsafe fallbacks, ownership errors, credential leaks, or
  PS/reflection faults; syntax checks OK; focused 48/48 and full 280/280 reproduced.
  No A1 changes were needed.
- 2026-07-12 — **Batch A2 complete**: M1 keyboard scoping via new
  `shared/keyboardFocus.mjs` (editable/interactive predicates + HUD key-mirror and
  Enter-nav handler factories) wired into `renderer/hud.js` + `renderer/setupFlow.js`;
  Enter in the Wi-Fi password field = JOIN; N1 renderer IPC-rejection hardening
  everywhere (visible `#bootError` + RETRY on failed initial settings load; fixed
  credential-free fallbacks for scan/join/hotspot/status/probe/apply/launch; save
  failures warn on team radio; credential-carrying channels withhold raw log detail);
  `renderer/index.html` + `hud.css` gained the boot-error block. New
  `test/keyboardFocus.test.js` (16) and `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` (8, real
  index.html + real renderer modules under jsdom with a mocked preload); `jsdom` added
  as a devDependency (D2's harness, pulled forward); `shared/keyboardFocus.mjs` added to
  the noControlPath guard list. Focused 72/72 (incl. A1 re-run); full suite **304/304**
  (27 files). NOT committed.
- 2026-07-12 — **A1 + A2 handoff re-verified in a fresh session** before A3: tree matched
  the checkpoint exactly (same `git status`, HEAD `cf038c2`, `git diff --check` clean);
  focused verification set (keyboardFocus/setupFlowDom/hotspot/wifiSim/runCommand/
  noControlPath) reproduced **72/72**. No A1/A2 changes needed.
- 2026-07-12 — **Batch A3 complete (code)**: M2 adapter-pinned status/join. Merged
  `parseNetshInterfaces` DELETED from `shared/wifiParse.js` (adapter status can no
  longer mix fields across blocks by construction); `main/wifiManager.js` `status()`
  gained `{iface}` pinning + honest `ok:false` netsh-failure results; `join()` verifies
  against the pinned block with last-poll-only timeout errors; `main/wifiSim.js` tracks
  joins PER ADAPTER (`interface=` respected) with distinct per-adapter signals;
  `shared/wifiView.mjs`: saved-adapter-missing now demands an explicit choice (disabled
  NOT DETECTED placeholder, `selected:''` — no silent fallback), labels carry
  same-object SSID+signal, new guide-mode state; `renderer/setupFlow.js`: ADAPTER row
  always rendered on PIT WALL (guide mode included, with the W17_WIFI_SIM dev hint),
  scan/join blocked while the picker is unresolved, guide VERIFY distinguishes a failed
  netsh status check from "not detected"; `renderer/hud.css`: `select:focus` teal
  border (parity with inputs — keyboard focus was invisible on the picker). 4 new
  fixtures (two-both EN, reversed EN, two-both DE, dongle-connecting EN). Tests:
  wifiParse 18, wifiManager 26, wifiView 12, wifiSim 13, setupFlowDom 12. Focused
  A3 **81/81**; A1/A2 regression **53/53**; full suite **327/327** (27 files, was
  304); `git diff --check` clean. Real netsh/RT5370 behavior remains bench-only.
  NOT committed.
- 2026-07-12 — **A3 adapter-card follow-up complete (Q7 decision: Option 2 "Adapter
  card")**. The user chose Option 2 with a refined spec (native `<select>` inside the
  card, no custom popup; keyboard/screen-reader preserved; `ADAPTER CHECK FAILED`
  wording). The ADAPTER row was promoted from a one-line span/select to a compact
  panel-style card reusing the PIT WALL vocabulary. `shared/wifiView.mjs`:
  `adapterRowState` now returns a card model (per-adapter `detail` with a
  connection-state chip, `selectedNote:'SELECTED'` for single, `selectorLabel`
  SELECT/CHANGE ADAPTER, `savedMissing`, `status`/`warn`/`rescan` for the degraded
  states; failure reason sanitized+capped; failed status text is now
  `ADAPTER CHECK FAILED`). `renderer/index.html`: card markup (`adapterhead`,
  `adapterdetail`, `adapterpick` w/ native select + chevron wrapper, `adapterstatus`,
  card `adapterRescan`). `renderer/setupFlow.js`: `renderAdapterCard(state)` renders the
  model; the picker change re-renders from a cached listing (immediate card update, no
  extra netsh call) + persists + rescans pinned; degraded states surface a card RESCAN
  and hide the join-pane RESCAN to avoid a duplicate. `renderer/hud.css`: `.adaptercard`
  + `.statechip` (teal/idle/amber) + native-select chevron/hover/focus; left accent
  teal=interactive / amber=warning / neutral=readonly. NO change to
  `wifiParse`/`wifiManager`/`wifiSim` (the two-adapter sim already demonstrates
  per-adapter switching, A3). Tests: `wifiView` 12→**14** (card model + sanitized
  reason), `setupFlowDom` 12→**14** (guide/zero/one/saved-missing/two-adapter card
  states, native-select assertion, change→persist→re-pin, no silent fallback). Focused
  adapter/view/DOM **28/28**; A1–A3 regression + noControlPath **110/110**; full suite
  **331/331** (27 files, was 327); `git diff --check` clean. Chromium visual eyeball of
  the four `W17_WIFI_SIM` scenarios remains a dev/bench manual item (jsdom can't render
  CSS). NOT committed.
- 2026-07-12 — **Adapter-card VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PASS complete (Electron, real app)**. Ran
  the real, unmodified app (`main/main.js`) under all six states — `W17_WIFI_SIM=`
  two-adapters / one-adapter / no-adapter / netsh-fail, plain (guide), and a seeded
  saved-missing — via a scratchpad Electron harness that boots the app, drives GARAGE →
  IPHONE COCKPIT → PIT WALL, and captures a screenshot + a computed-style/DOM dump per
  state (harness is scratchpad-only, never committed). Every state rendered correctly
  (card layout, chip tones, SELECTED/CHANGE/SELECT ADAPTER labels, teal chevron, amber
  NOT DETECTED, single-RESCAN degraded states, guide note, per-adapter switching, no
  page-level horizontal overflow). **Two small objective visual fixes applied to
  `renderer/hud.css`:** (1) the native `<select>` overflowed to the card's right edge
  (ellipsis/chevron cramped against the border) — the picker is now a column (label above)
  with the select at `width:100%` so it ellipsizes with the card padding as breathing room;
  (2) the card was ~12 px wider than the network list below it — card width set to
  `min(46ch,80vw)` to match the netlist so their right edges align. **One a11y fix to
  `renderer/index.html`:** the `<select>` had no programmatic name (only visible text
  labels) — added `aria-label="WLAN adapter"` (pinned by a new assertion in
  `test/setupFlowDom.test.js`). Focus was verified clearly visible (bright-teal select
  border on focus per app convention; prominent focus ring on the RESCAN button) — no
  focus change needed. No interaction/redesign change. Re-ran: focused adapter/view/DOM
  **28/28**, A1–A3 regression + noControlPath **110/110**, full suite **331/331**,
  `git diff --check` clean. Touched only `renderer/hud.css`, `renderer/index.html`,
  `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` — the `git status` file set is unchanged. NOT committed.
- 2026-07-13 — **Batch B1 + B2 + N3 complete (code)** — M3 (hotspot lifecycle + quit
  policy), N3 (non-blocking probe), L1→B2 (locale-neutral errors). One combined batch.
  New main-process runtime authority `main/hotspotLifecycle.js` (238→now ~250 lines):
  wraps `HotspotManager` and owns the phase model INACTIVE→STARTING→LIVE→STOPPING with an
  honest error presentation (failed start → INACTIVE + lastError + B2 suggestion; failed
  stop → LIVE, ownership retained, retryable; config-mismatch partial start → LIVE + error
  + owned, ssid withheld). Duplicate start/stop suppressed at the authority (`kind:'busy'`).
  Capability probe (N3) is cached + single-flight + `{refresh}`-able, emits a `probing`
  snapshot immediately, and turns a rejection into a controlled `failed` status. New
  `main/quitPolicy.js` (92 lines): `before-quit` shows the STOP AND QUIT / LEAVE RUNNING /
  CANCEL dialog ONLY when the app owns the hotspot, waits for a settled state (quit during
  STARTING/STOPPING), stops-then-quits, keeps the app open on a failed stop, and has no
  recursive-quit loop (a decision latches `allowQuit`). `main/main.js`: capabilities no
  longer probes; new `wifi:hotspot-state`/`wifi:hotspot-probe` IPC; the lifecycle pushes
  every snapshot to the renderer over `hotspot-state`; `before-quit` wired to the policy;
  the hotspot is deliberately NOT torn down in `will-quit`. `main/preload.cjs`:
  `hotspotState`/`hotspotProbe`/`onHotspotState` added (minimum surface). B2 in
  `main/hotspot.js`: the English `/denied|elevat|administrator/` regex is DELETED; hosted
  start failures classify as generic `start-failed`+`backend:'hosted'` and consult a new
  locale-neutral `PS_ELEV` token (`WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole` → `ELEV_ADMIN`/`ELEV_LIMITED`)
  to decide whether to attach the administrator SUGGESTION (never when elevated; kept when
  unknown); mobile results gained `backend:'mobile'`; a failed hosted fallback keeps the
  superseded mobile failure as `fallbackFrom`; raw localized detail is retained sanitized.
  `shared/wifiView.mjs`: new pure `hotspotPaneState(snap)` maps the lifecycle snapshot to
  the pane's controls/text. `renderer/setupFlow.js`: HOTSPOT pane renders exclusively from
  main's snapshots via one `adoptHotspotSnap` gate; START/STOP handlers only issue requests.
  `renderer/index.html`+`hud.css`: STOP HOTSPOT button, `hsHint`, RECHECK SUPPORT, disabled
  styling. **Lifecycle sequence race found + fixed during the Electron sim pass** (see the
  next entry). New tests: `test/hotspotLifecycle.test.js` (**26**), `test/quitPolicy.test.js`
  (**13**), `test/hotspot.test.js` +7 B2/backend (23→**31**), `test/wifiView.test.js`
  +11 pane (14→**25**), `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` +9 pane +9 race (14→**31**),
  `test/wifiSim.test.js` +1 elev (13→**14**), 2 new fixtures
  (`netsh_hosted_start_failed_en/de.txt`), `test/noControlPath.test.js` guard-list +2
  (lifecycle + quitPolicy). Full suite **407/407** (29 files, was 331/27); focused
  lifecycle/quit/probe/B2/pane/DOM/noControlPath all green; `git diff --check` clean.
  Real WinRT/netsh/localized-Windows behavior remains bench-only. NOT committed.
- 2026-07-13 — **Lifecycle SEQUENCE RACE — discovered + fixed (Electron sim pass).** The
  real-app Electron harness (scratchpad-only) exposed a delivery-order defect the jsdom
  tests could not: Electron does **not** guarantee `webContents.send` pushes arrive in emit
  order. A `probe:'probing'` push (emitted first, inside the `hotspotProbe` IPC turn) was
  delivered to the renderer AFTER its own `supported` completion push, so the stale
  `probing` overwrote `supported` and the pane wedged on `CHECKING HOTSPOT SUPPORT…`
  forever (send-log `#1 probing #2 supported`; page received `[supported, probing]`).
  Root cause: the renderer trusted arrival order. Fix: snapshots carry a monotonic `seq`
  from the authority (`_emit()` bumps `_seq`; `snapshot()` reports it); the renderer routes
  BOTH the pull and push paths through one `adoptHotspotSnap(snap)` gate that drops any
  `snap.seq < heldSeq`. Equal seq is idempotent; a missing seq (legacy) is adopted
  last-writer-wins; the renderer never mints a seq. Post-fix the harness reproduced the
  exact out-of-order delivery and the pane settled to `READY — mobile backend` correctly,
  through the full START→LIVE→(nav away/back)→STOP cycle. Regression tests:
  `test/hotspotLifecycle.test.js` "snapshots carry a strictly increasing seq…" and a
  `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` "hotspot snapshot adoption / lifecycle sequence race" block
  (9 cases: stale pushed-vs-pulled either way, equal-seq idempotence, newer STOPPING /
  stop-error adoption, old-cannot-re-enable-START-while-owned, boot with no held seq,
  real-lifecycle seq survives start→live→stop + re-entry). This race was NOT in the
  original audit — jsdom delivers listener callbacks synchronously and never reorders.
- 2026-07-13 — **B1/B2/N3 Electron simulation acceptance (real app, scratchpad harness).**
  Ran `main/main.js` unmodified under `W17_WIFI_SIM=two-adapters` and `=netsh-fail`,
  driving GARAGE→IPHONE COCKPIT→PIT WALL→HOTSPOT and sampling the pane + capturing
  screenshots per state. **two-adapters:** send-log `#1 probing #2 supported #3 starting
  #4 live #5 stopping #6 inactive` all delivered and adopted in causal order; pane went
  READY (START enabled, STOP disabled) → START → LIVE (`LIVE (mobile) — join "W17-GRID"…`,
  teal, START disabled, STOP enabled, SSID/PASS disabled) → NEXT/BACK still LIVE (no stale
  pull overwrite) → STOP → READY (START re-enabled, STOP disabled), radio logged HOTSPOT
  LIVE then STOPPED; adapter card unaffected throughout. **netsh-fail:** probe reported
  `READY — hosted backend` while the adapter card independently showed `ADAPTER CHECK
  FAILED` (capability NOT conflated with adapter availability); START surfaced
  `hostednetwork config failed: … (wlansvc) is not running.` with RECHECK visible; RECHECK
  re-probed. Screenshots (LIVE, after-STOP, netsh-fail failure) visually confirmed.
  Transient STARTING/STOPPING-disabled visuals and the stop-failure/retry path are not
  sim-reachable (the sim always succeeds, instantly) — those are proven by the DOM
  integration tests (real renderer + real lifecycle + routed failing runner) and the
  lifecycle/quit unit tests. This is dev-preview evidence only; NOT real-Windows evidence.
- 2026-07-13 — **Batch B3 complete (code)** — L2 Wi-Fi security scope (decision Q3). A
  normalized security model now drives the join flow; the renderer + manager branch on it,
  never on localized netsh prose. `shared/wifiParse.js`: `parseNetshNetworks` now also
  captures the **encryption** field (3rd positional) and attaches a normalized `security`
  kind via the new exported `classifyWifiSecurity({auth,encryption})`; raw auth/encryption
  are retained for diagnostics; empty/whitespace SSIDs stay dropped. New
  `buildOpenWlanProfileXml(ssid)` (authentication=open, encryption=none, NO key; SSID
  XML-escaped). `shared/wifiView.mjs`: new pure `joinPlan(n)` (reject/open/join/password
  decision) + `networkBadge(n)` + exported Q3 strings (`WPA3_ONLY_MESSAGE`,
  `ENTERPRISE_MESSAGE`, `OPEN_NETWORK_WARNING`). `main/wifiManager.js`: `join()` gained
  `{security, known}` — rejects `wpa3-only`/`enterprise`/empty-SSID BEFORE any OS call with
  stable kinds (`unsupported-wpa3`/`unsupported-enterprise`/`unsupported-hidden-network`),
  installs an OPEN profile for a new open network, a `password-required` controlled error
  for a secured no-profile-no-password case, and preserves the WPA2-PSK path + temp-file
  cleanup + adapter pinning + redaction. `renderer/setupFlow.js`: `selectNetwork` branches
  on `joinPlan` (OPEN warning + hidden password + JOIN; WPA3/enterprise reject message;
  transition/unknown caution note), `doJoin` passes `security`+`known`, the row badge shows
  the security kind. `renderer/index.html`: `#netSecNote`. `renderer/hud.css`: `.hint.warn`
  (amber) + **`#netPassword.hidden{display:none}`** (this stylesheet has no global `.hidden`
  rule — see the CSS defect below). `main/wifiSim.js`: `NETWORKS_TEXT` expanded to span the
  branches (open/WPA3-only/enterprise + an empty-SSID block that must be skipped). New
  fixtures `netsh_networks_security_en.txt`, `netsh_networks_open_de.txt`. Tests: wifiParse
  18→**39**, wifiManager 26→**35**, wifiView 25→**34**, wifiSim 14→**16**, setupFlowDom
  31→**40**. NOT committed.
- 2026-07-13 — **CSS defect found + fixed in the B3 Electron pass** (not visible to jsdom).
  Hiding the open-network password field via `netPassword.classList.add('hidden')` was a
  visual NO-OP: this stylesheet has no global `.hidden{display:none}` — every hideable
  element carries its own scoped rule (`.netjoinrow.hidden{…}`, `.hint.hidden{…}`, …), and
  there was none for the `<input id="netPassword">`, so the class was set (jsdom saw it,
  tests passed) but the field still rendered. The real app screenshot exposed it; fixed by
  adding `#netPassword.hidden{display:none}` to `renderer/hud.css`. jsdom does not apply the
  linked stylesheet or compute layout, so the DOM test's class assertion cannot catch this —
  the Electron `getComputedStyle` sample (`display:"none"`, JOIN still `block`) is the proof.
- 2026-07-13 — **Batch B4 complete (code)** — L4 reachability probe classification. The
  probe stays ICMP (a TCP port has no defensible meaning: the iPhone HUD receives W2 over
  UDP 5601, gated by iOS Local Network permission; the phone screen is the final evidence),
  but classifies from STABLE STRUCTURAL signals instead of exit code alone.
  `main/hostProbe.js`: new exported pure `classifyPing(res, platform)` →
  `reachable | timeout | unreachable | invalid | command-unavailable | command-error |
  unknown`. Rules: a `TTL=` echo reply (locale-neutral token) is the ONLY green; a Windows
  exit-0 reply WITHOUT `TTL=` is the audit-L4 "Destination host unreachable" false-green and
  is classed **unreachable**, never reachable; a corroborating multi-locale phrase set backs
  it up; conservative `unknown` where localization prevents certainty. `probe()` returns
  `{ok, status, rttMs?|error}` (backward-compatible `.ok`). New `shared/reachability.mjs`
  (`PATH_ONLY_NOTE` = the exact decision-C4 wording + `probeStatusLine`) — added to the
  noControlPath guard list. `renderer/setupFlow.js`: the PIT WALL CHECK shows the honest
  per-status line and, on success, the full path-only caveat (`#addrNote`) so a green check
  can never read as "the iPhone HUD is receiving". `renderer/index.html`: `#addrNote`. New
  fixtures `ping_win_{reachable,timeout,unreachable}_en.txt` + `_de` reachable/unreachable.
  New tests `test/hostProbe.test.js` (**16**), `test/reachability.test.js` (**7**);
  setupFlowDom gained the B3+B4 UI cases (part of the 40). `test/noControlPath.test.js`
  guard-list +1 (`shared/reachability.mjs`). NOT committed. (The decision-C4 wording is
  realized here because the B4 spec mandates it under "Product truthfulness"; the other
  Batch C items — C1/C2/C3/C5 — remain untouched.)
- 2026-07-13 — **B3+B4 Electron simulation acceptance (real app, scratchpad harness).** A
  hidden BrowserWindow loaded the REAL `renderer/index.html` + REAL preload with the REAL
  managers over the `two-adapters` sim runner (harness scratchpad-only, never committed).
  **B3:** PIT WALL rows rendered with security badges — PaddockNet `KNOWN`, Cafe Guest 2.4
  `OPEN`, Paddock 6E `WPA3`, Team Corp `802.1X`; the empty-SSID block was absent (never a
  clickable row). OPEN → amber "OPEN NETWORK — no password; traffic is unencrypted", the
  password field computed `display:none` while JOIN stayed `block`. WPA3-only → exact Q3
  message, JOIN row hidden. Enterprise → "Enterprise (802.1X) networks are not currently
  supported…", JOIN row hidden. Adapter card stayed pinned/interactive (CHANGE ADAPTER,
  Wi-Fi selected) throughout — no adapter/hotspot regression. **B4:** 10.0.0.1 (canned
  reachable) → "REACHABLE 0ms — network path only" + the full path-only caveat shown;
  10.0.0.2 (timeout) → "NO REPLY — timed out", caveat hidden; 10.0.0.3 (canned exit-0
  Destination-unreachable) → "UNREACHABLE — no route to the phone" (the false-green surfaces
  RED), caveat hidden. Screenshots captured to scratchpad. Dev-preview only; NOT
  real-Windows evidence.
- 2026-07-13 — **B3 correction (user review): `unknown` security now fails conservatively.**
  The initial B3 pass routed `unknown` to a best-effort WPA2 password path — a deviation from
  Q3 (unknown must NOT be treated as WPA2). Corrected: `joinPlan` returns `reject` for a NEW
  unknown network (`unsupported-unknown-security`, message "This network's security type could
  not be identified. Use a known WPA2 network or start the W17 hotspot."), and
  `wifiManager.join` rejects `unknown && known !== true` BEFORE any OS call — no WPA2 profile,
  no `netsh connect`, even if a password is supplied. Sanitized raw auth/enc are preserved for
  a diagnostics tooltip (`securityDiag` → `netSecNote.title`), never the primary UI message.
  **Saved-profile carve-out (deliberate, documented, tested both ways):** a network Windows
  already has a saved profile for (`known:true`) still joins via that profile — the existing
  known-network `connect name=X` path constructs nothing and speculates nothing, so it is
  safe and is NOT a regression. Tests: wifiView 34→**35** (new-unknown reject + saved-unknown
  join), wifiManager 35→**36** (reject-with-password-still-no-OS-call + saved-profile connect),
  setupFlowDom 40→**42** (DOM: controlled message, password/JOIN hidden, no join call, raw only
  in the tooltip; saved-unknown joins). Full suite **480→484**; `git diff --check` clean. The
  `git status` file set is unchanged (same 47 entries).
- 2026-07-13 — **B3 unknown-security correction independently re-verified (start of the Batch C
  session).** A skeptical re-read confirmed the working tree already fails `unknown` conservatively
  (no `unknown → password` path anywhere): `joinPlan` returns `reject` for a NEW unknown
  (`shared/wifiView.mjs`), `wifiManager.join` rejects `unknown && known !== true` BEFORE any OS
  call even with a password supplied (`main/wifiManager.js:133`, test asserts zero spawned
  commands), the saved-profile carve-out joins via the stored profile constructing nothing, and
  the matrix (§ below) is conservative. Focused re-run 291/291 (wifi + hostProbe + reachability +
  A1–B2 lifecycle + noControlPath); `git diff --check` clean. **No B3 change was needed** — the
  correction logged above was already in place.
- 2026-07-13 — **Batch C complete (code) — truthful runtime state + configuration UX.** C1 video
  state (L3), C2 replay chip (D1/Q4), C3 env-locked settings (D3/Q8), C5 W2-on-GRID wording
  (D2/Q5); C4 reachability wording re-validated (landed in B4). **New files:**
  `shared/videoState.mjs` (pure video-state reducer + view), `shared/envLocks.mjs` (pure env-lock
  mapping), `test/videoState.test.js` (16), `test/whep.test.js` (5). **Modified:**
  `renderer/whep.js` (transport `onStatus` + stale-pc identity guard), `renderer/hud.js`
  (video-state authority, media listeners, feed-note wording, replay chip, `videoPlaying` derived
  from the model for GRID + W2), `renderer/setupFlow.js` (env-lock ⚙ presentation + partial-lock
  save guards, replay-chip refresh after applySession, GRID W2 note), `renderer/index.html`
  (`#feedNoteText`, `#replayChip`, ENV badges, `#gridNote`), `renderer/hud.css` (feed-note tones,
  `.replaychip`, `.envbadge`/`.setctl`/readable-disabled), `main/main.js` (`config:get` →
  `telemetrySource`; `settings:get` → `effective`), `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` +15 (42→**57**),
  `test/noControlPath.test.js` (guard-list +2: `videoState`, `envLocks`). Focused C 85/85
  (videoState 16, whep 5, reachability/C4 7, setupFlowDom 57); A1–B4 regression + noControlPath
  242/242; full suite `npm test` **520/520 (33 files)** (was 484/31); `git diff --check` clean.
  Electron visual acceptance (scratchpad harness, real renderer + real CSS, dev-preview only)
  passed for all four (see the Batch C status section). NOT committed.
- 2026-07-13 — **Batch D1 + D4 complete (code) — no-control-path directory sweep + command
  generation hardening.** D1 (V1): the two enumerated file lists in
  `test/noControlPath.test.js` are DELETED and replaced by a symlink-safe **directory sweep**
  of `main/`+`shared/`+`renderer/` that scans every discovered `.js/.mjs/.cjs` runtime module
  (10→**15** tests); all prior semantic assertions are preserved verbatim. D4: an audit of
  every external-command construction path plus a new consolidated
  `test/commandGeneration.test.js` suite (**17** tests) and **two objective source fixes** — (1) `main/wifiManager.js` now writes
  the key-bearing WLAN profile into a PRIVATE per-join `mkdtemp` directory (0700, removed in a
  `finally` after success AND failure) instead of a predictable `w17-wlan-<ms>.xml` in the
  shared tmpdir (CWE-377 symlink/pre-creation race + same-ms collision); (2) `main/runCommand.js`
  extracts the N4 tree-kill argv into an exported pure `winTreeKillArgs(pid)` so the `/t /f`
  flags are regression-tested. No behavior change to A–C. Only new untracked file is
  `test/commandGeneration.test.js` (git status 52→**53**). Full suite `npm test` **542/542
  (34 files)** (was 520/33); `git diff --check` clean. Real-Windows command behavior remains
  bench-only. NOT committed. See the Batch D status section below.
- 2026-07-14 — **BASELINE SHIFT: the user committed the entire pass as `79fa2e0`**
  ("a lot of chagnes", 62 files) — everything from A1 through D1/D4 PLUS the partial D2
  work of the interrupted 2026-07-14 session PLUS the separate 2026-07-14 contract-mirror
  docs session (`docs/windows_bridge_contract.md` sync from canonical `iPhone_rc@84532ed`,
  `docs/camera_aim_display_semantics.md`, `docs/video_topology_baseline.md`,
  readiness-doc superseded note). The "everything uncommitted at `cf038c2`" rule ended by
  the user's own action; work from here stays uncommitted ON TOP of `79fa2e0`.
- 2026-07-14 — **Batch D2 complete (code) — main-process + setup-flow integration coverage
  (V2/N1).** Started in the interrupted 2026-07-14 session (committed inside `79fa2e0`),
  completed in the recovery session (4 uncommitted files: `main/main.js`,
  `main/appWiring.js`, `test/appWiring.test.js`, `test/ipcSurface.test.js`).
  `main/main.js` (222 lines) remains the composition root and the ONLY W3 wiring site,
  but every wiring seam moved to the new **`main/appWiring.js`** and unit-tests with
  fakes: `createNetworkServices` (sim routing + the ONE `HotspotLifecycle` authority),
  `telemetrySourceFor`, `createSessionApplier` (settings+env → `resolveEffective` →
  runtime + injected `applyW3`), `createKeyedInstance` (the W3 receiver's idempotent
  restart choreography — construction stays in main.js), `mediamtxPaths` (+
  `W17_MEDIAMTX_DIR` override, the D3 smoke seam), `registerIpcHandlers` (single-sited,
  duplicate-proof, returns the channel lists), `wireHotspotPush` (+ `PUSH_CHANNELS`
  constants), `createWindowOptions`, `installNavigationPolicy`, `createTeardown`.
  `w3ConfigFor(effective, env)` moved to `main/headTrackingConfig.js` (pure,
  allowlisted). **Objective defects found + fixed (4):** (1) `enterGrid`
  orphaned-interval race — leaving GRID while `session:apply` was in flight let the
  stale continuation start the 1 s checklist poll forever (ping + elrs probes from the
  wrong screen); fixed with a `gridEpoch` guard; (2) the same class in `enterPitwall`
  (2 s addr-hint poll + stale DOM writes after the capability/adapter awaits); fixed
  with entry-epoch guards; (3) `will-quit` teardown was not failure-isolated — a
  throwing stop skipped the remaining steps (orphaned mediamtx); fixed via
  `createTeardown` (idempotent + per-step isolation); (4) the BrowserWindow had no
  window-open/navigation policy — `installNavigationPolicy` now denies `window.open`
  and renderer-initiated navigation outright (the app is one local page; `loadFile` is
  unaffected). New tests: `test/appWiring.test.js` (**43**), `test/ipcSurface.test.js`
  (**15**, static pins comment-stripped so a channel name in a comment can neither
  satisfy nor trip them), `test/headTracking.test.js` +5 `w3ConfigFor` (33→**38**),
  `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` +5 D2 renderer block (57→**62**: config-rejection
  resilience, subscription singletons, both race fixes under fake timers installed
  BEFORE the interval exists, exactly-one-interval accounting across leave/re-entry).
  Full suite `npm test` **610/610 (36 files)** (was 542/34); `git diff --check` clean.
  D3 NOT started (stop-for-review after the composition-root refactor). See the Batch
  D2 status section below.

## Current transfer checkpoint

**Purpose: a self-contained handoff for a fresh model with NO conversation history or
session memory. Describes the ACTUAL working tree after Batches A1 + A2 + A3, the A3
adapter-card follow-up (Q7 Option 2), Batch B1 + B2 + N3 (hotspot lifecycle, quit policy,
non-blocking probe, locale-neutral errors, sequence-race fix), Batch B3 + B4 (Wi-Fi
security scope + reachability probe classification), **Batch C** (C1 video-state model,
C2 replay chip, C3 env-locked settings, C5 W2-on-GRID docs; C4 re-validated), **Batch
D1 + D4** (no-control-path directory sweep + command-generation hardening), and **Batch
D2** (main-process + setup-flow integration coverage, composition-root refactor) — not
the intended design. Authoritative cross-account handoff (session memory is a
convenience copy). **D1, D4, and D2 are DONE. Next up is Batch D3** (Electron boot
smoke + Windows CI step) — do not start until the user reviews the D2 refactor and
resumes. E/F/G remain untouched.**

### Repository state

- Repo: `w17-ground-station` (nested git repo under `.../Documents/projects/`).
- Branch: `main`. **HEAD commit: `79fa2e0`** ("a lot of chagnes", 2026-07-14 14:13,
  **committed by the user** — 62 files carrying the entire A1→D1/D4 pass, the partial-D2
  work of the interrupted 2026-07-14 session, and the separate 2026-07-14
  contract-mirror docs). Parent: `cf038c2` — the commit this audit originally examined;
  every finding/batch above still references that baseline.
- **Uncommitted right now (D2 completion, this recovery session — 5 M, nothing else):**
  ```
   M docs/audits/2026-07-12-pre-hardware-hardening-audit.md   (this update)

   M test/appWiring.test.js   (+4 keyed-instance tests -> 43)
   M test/ipcSurface.test.js  (static pins comment-stripped + count pins)
  ```
- HISTORICAL — the uncommitted set that became `79fa2e0` (A1 + A2 + A3 + B1/B2 + B3/B4 +
  **Batch C** + **Batch D1/D4** combined — **53 entries, 22 M / 31 ??**; the 4 extra
  doc entries from the contract-mirror session joined at commit time). Batch D added ONE
  new untracked file
  (`test/commandGeneration.test.js`) and re-edited three already-tracked files in place
  (`main/runCommand.js`, `main/wifiManager.js`, `test/noControlPath.test.js`), so only the

### Batch D2 status: COMPLETE (code) — real-Electron boot proof is D3

Scope was exactly **D2** (V2/N1: main-process + setup-flow integration coverage). D3 was
NOT started — the composition-root refactor below is deliberately stopped for review
first. No control-path, CRSF-encoder, pan/tilt, or W3-wiring change; W3/5602 stays
log-only (the directory sweep + the pinned symmetry tests keep proving it); contract
§1–§7 untouched by this session.

**Composition-root refactor.** `main/main.js` (222 lines) is still the composition root
— Electron imports, window creation, quit-policy install, app lifecycle events, and the
ONLY W3 receiver construction site — but every wiring seam now lives in
**`main/appWiring.js`** (~310 lines) behind injected dependencies, so the integration
layer unit-tests without booting Electron. `appWiring` holds NO production singletons
(everything is factory-constructed by main.js), never names head-tracking (guard-swept),
and registers the IPC surface in exactly one place.

| Seam (`main/appWiring.js`) | What it pins | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `PUSH_CHANNELS` | the two main→renderer push names; preload subscription equality | ipcSurface |
| `createNetworkServices({env,log})` | `W17_WIFI_SIM` routing (sim managers as win32 vs real), ONE `HotspotLifecycle` authority | appWiring 2 |
| `telemetrySourceFor(cfg,{platform,log})` | replay/crsf-serial/none → instance; COM5 / /dev/ttyUSB0 defaults | appWiring 4 |
| `createSessionApplier({settingsStore,runtime,env,applyW3,warn})` | settings+env → `resolveEffective` → `runtime.applyConfig` → injected `applyW3`; retains `lastEffective` for config/settings answers | appWiring 13 |
| `createKeyedInstance({construct,keyOf})` | W3 receiver restart choreography: idempotent re-apply, stop-before-replace, stop-on-null; CONSTRUCTION stays in main.js | appWiring 4 |
| `mediamtxPaths({env,platform,isPackaged,resourcesPath,projectRoot})` | dev/packaged split + **`W17_MEDIAMTX_DIR`** override (built as the deterministic missing-binary seam for the D3 smoke) | appWiring 3 |
| `registerIpcHandlers({ipcMain,services})` | the whole renderer-facing surface, single-sited + duplicate-throwing; returns channel lists for the symmetry test | appWiring 8 + ipcSurface |
| `wireHotspotPush({lifecycle,broadcast})` | every lifecycle snapshot → `hotspot-state`, seq preserved, unsubscribe works | appWiring 2 |
| `createWindowOptions({preloadPath,iconPath})` | contextIsolation ON / nodeIntegration OFF / sandbox ON / preload path — pinned | appWiring 2 |
| `installNavigationPolicy(webContents,{log})` | `window.open` denied; renderer-initiated navigation prevented (one local page) | appWiring 2 |
| `createTeardown({steps,log})` | idempotent, per-step failure-isolated shutdown; hotspot deliberately NOT a step | appWiring 4 |
| `w3ConfigFor(effective,env)` (in `main/headTrackingConfig.js`, allowlisted) | env master force-off vs persisted wish vs sub-key overrides | headTracking +5 |

**Final wiring map (all symmetric — pinned by `test/ipcSurface.test.js`).** 18 invoke
channels + 1 fire-and-forget send + 2 push channels; 20 preload methods; every method has
exactly one registered handler/event source AND at least one renderer consumer; the only
`ipcMain` registration site is `registerIpcHandlers`; main.js sends only through
`PUSH_CHANNELS`. Static pins run against comment-stripped code so a channel name in a
comment can neither satisfy a contains-pin nor trip a bans-pin.

| Area | Main wiring | IPC | Preload | Renderer consumer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Config snapshot | services → `config:get` (whepUrl, effective source, setupCompleted, envOverridden, w3Active, feel) | `config:get` | `getConfig` | `hud.js init()` |
| Settings read | store.load + effective 3-field display block | `settings:get` | `getSettings` | `setupFlow boot()`, `hud init()` |
| Settings write | store.save(patch) | `settings:set` | `setSettings` | `setupFlow save()` |
| Session apply | `sessionApplier.apply()` (→ runtime + applyW3) | `session:apply` | `applySession` | `enterGrid`, ⚙ handlers |
| Wi-Fi capability/adapters/scan/join/status | `wifi.*` (+sim flag) | `wifi:*` (5) | `wifiCapabilities/Interfaces/Scan/Join/Status` | PIT WALL |
| Hotspot start/stop/state/probe | `hotspotLifecycle.*` (THE authority) | `wifi:hotspot-*` (4) | `hotspotStart/Stop/State/Probe` | HOTSPOT pane |
| Hotspot push | `wireHotspotPush` → broadcast to all windows | push `hotspot-state` | `onHotspotState` | `adoptHotspotSnap` seq gate |
| Addr hint / reachability | `addrHint.get` / `hostProbe.probe` | `setup:addr-hint`, `setup:probe-host` | `getAddrHint`, `probeHost` | addr row, GRID checks |
| ELRS | `elrs.detectRunning/launchDetached` (path re-read from store per call) | `elrs:status`, `elrs:launch` | `elrsStatus`, `elrsLaunch` | GRID checklist |
| Telemetry push | `runtime.setSnapshotSink` → window | push `telemetry` | `onTelemetry` | `hud.js` |
| Command mirror | `ipcMain.on` → `runtime.onCommandMirror` (one-way, display-only) | send `command-mirror` | `sendCommandMirror` | `hud sendCommandMirror` |
| Quit policy / shutdown | same `hotspotLifecycle` instance; `createTeardown` (no hotspot step) | — | — | — |

**Objective defects found + fixed (4)** — see the 2026-07-14 change-log entry for detail:
the `enterGrid` and `enterPitwall` orphaned-interval races (stale continuations after
navigation could leak a forever-polling 1 s/2 s interval; fixed with entry-epoch guards +
deterministic fake-timer tests), the non-failure-isolated `will-quit` teardown (one
throwing stop orphaned the rest; fixed via `createTeardown`), and the missing
window-open/navigation policy (now deny-all; the app is a single local page).

**Coverage highlights (what D2 now proves without Electron):** clean/corrupted settings
boot; env override + explicit `0` force-off + partial locks; replay/live source
selection; desktop-never-starts-W2 / iphone+target-starts-W2 / missing-target-does-not;
repeated apply idempotent; target change rekeys with exactly one live sender; W3
persisted-wish vs env-master vs sub-key overrides; W3 receiver restart idempotence;
secrets absent from effective/env metadata (the persisted hotspot password reaches the
renderer ONLY inside `settings.network.hotspot` — the documented E1 residual); hotspot
IPC delegates 1:1 with defaulted opts; snapshots push with rising seq and no credential;
shutdown idempotent + failure-isolated + never the hotspot; renderer config-rejection
resilience; module-lifetime subscription singletons; exactly-one-interval accounting
across PIT WALL leave/re-entry and GRID leave-during-apply.

**Remaining D2 limitations (all deliberate, D3 territory):** `registerIpcHandlers` is
proven against a strict FAKE ipcMain — the real Electron binding, actual preload
execution in a sandboxed renderer, runtime enforcement of the window flags, and
"unknown channels unavailable" in a LIVE renderer need the D3 boot smoke. `applyW3` in
main.js is now a one-line composition of two tested halves (`w3ConfigFor` +
`createKeyedInstance`) but the line itself runs only in Electron. `createWindow`'s
snapshot-sink-per-window behavior and the `activate` re-create path are likewise
smoke-only. jsdom still proves wiring, not Chromium rendering.

### Batch D1 + D4 status: COMPLETE (code) — real-Windows command behavior bench-pending

Scope was exactly **D1 and D4**. D2, D3, E, F, G were NOT started. No control-path,
CRSF-encoder, pan/tilt, or W3-wiring change; W3/5602 stays log-only; contract §1–§7 untouched.

**D1 — no-control-path guard is now a directory sweep (finding V1).** The two enumerated
lists in `test/noControlPath.test.js` (`runtimeFiles`, `setupFlowFiles`) are DELETED. The
guard now discovers files by walking `main/`+`shared/`+`renderer/` and scans every runtime
module found, so a NEW module cannot bypass the bans by not being on a list. All prior
SEMANTIC assertions are preserved verbatim (crsf no-encoder, bridge send-only/no-serial,
snapshot pure, HT-modules inert, receiver-feeds-nothing, elrs launch-only, W3 addr-seam
IP-only, main.js constructed-not-read). 10→**15** tests.

- **Discovery** (`discover(absDir, baseDir)`): recursive `readdirSync(..,{withFileTypes})`;
  **symlinks are NOT traversed** — a symlink is recorded as `unknown` (surfaced, never
  followed), closing an uncontrolled-traversal / scan-attacker-content hole. `*.test.*`/
  `*.spec.*` are skipped (not runtime). Extensions are classified: `RUNTIME_EXT`
  = `.js/.mjs/.cjs` (scanned); `ASSET_EXT` = `.css/.html/.map/.json/.png/.svg/.ico/.icns/
  .txt/.md/.yml/.yaml` (present, not scanned); anything else → `unknown` and the guard FAILS
  until it is intentionally classified (a novel `.ts`/generated bundle cannot slip through).
- **Per-file scan** (`scanRuntimeFile`) with three rule classes + narrow, documented
  exceptions; failures name the exact file AND matched rule:
  - `ALWAYS_FORBIDDEN` (control-OUTPUT primitives, **no exception, all files**):
    `CrsfFrameBuilder`, `buildRcChannels`, `encodeRcChannels`, `RcChannels`, `setPosition`,
    `setThrottle`, `ledc`. Grep-verified to appear in **zero** runtime files today.
  - `SERIAL_TOKENS` (`serialport`/`SerialPort`) banned everywhere EXCEPT `SERIAL_ALLOWED` =
    `{main/CrsfSerialSource.js, shared/crsfTelemetry.js}` — the read-only CRSF telemetry
    backchannel (telemetry IN, never control OUT; the ALWAYS_FORBIDDEN sweep still covers
    them). `crsfTelemetry.js` only names it in a `pure (no serialport)` comment.
  - `HEADTRACK_RE` (`/headTracking|HeadTracking/` — camelCase identifiers, so harmless UI
    prose like `HEAD-TRACK LOGGING` never trips) banned everywhere EXCEPT `HEADTRACK_ALLOWED`
    = `{main/main.js, main/HeadTrackingReceiver.js, main/headTrackingConfig.js,
    shared/headTracking.js}` — the single wiring site + the receiver's own modules. **This
    is the core V1 fix**: a new consumer that imports/mentions head-tracking is auto-caught.
- **Module-graph vs. text-scan:** a full AST/import-graph pass was considered and judged
  unnecessary here — any import must textually name the distinctive module identifier, the
  renderer is sandboxed and reaches main only through the enumerated preload IPC channels,
  and the head-tracking-identifier ban already catches the first step of any control path.
  The `main.js` data-flow assertions (`no getDiagnostics`, no `headTracking.(on|emit|pipe)`)
  are kept as the targeted complement.
- **Auto-discovery proof (2 tests):** (a) a hermetic temp dir with a planted
  `sneakyControl.js` (imports the receiver AND exports `encodeRcChannels`) is discovered and
  flagged on BOTH counts, while a `.css` is an asset, a `*.test.js` is skipped, a `.ts` is
  `unknown`, and a `.js` **symlink** is `unknown`/not-scanned; (b) the real sweep is asserted
  to include the recently-added `shared/videoState.mjs`, `shared/envLocks.mjs`,
  `shared/reachability.mjs`, `shared/keyboardFocus.mjs`, `main/hotspotLifecycle.js`,
  `main/quitPolicy.js` — none on any list — proving new REAL files are picked up with no edit.
- **Exceptions are narrow and documented** (the two SERIAL_ALLOWED, the four
  HEADTRACK_ALLOWED); a test pins that a serial-exempt file is exempt ONLY for serial, never
  for a control-output primitive, and that a non-`main.js` module is never head-track-exempt.

**D4 — command-generation and invocation hardening.** Full inventory (every `runCommand`/
`spawn`/`spawnSync`/`execFile` consumer):

| Command path | Executable | Arguments / input | User-controlled data | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi scan | `netsh` | `wlan show networks mode=bssid [interface=<iface>]` + `wlan show profiles` | `iface` (argv element) | wifiManager, commandGeneration |
| Adapter list | `netsh` | `wlan show interfaces` | none | wifiManager |
| Wi-Fi status | `netsh` | `wlan show interfaces` | none (`iface` selected in parsed text) | wifiManager |
| Add profile | `netsh` | `wlan add profile filename=<tmp> [interface=<iface>]` | SSID+key ride the temp **XML file** (XML-escaped), `iface` argv | wifiManager, commandGeneration |
| Wi-Fi connect | `netsh` | `wlan connect name=<ssid> [interface=<iface>]` | `ssid`,`iface` argv elements | wifiManager, commandGeneration |
| Hosted set/start/stop | `netsh` | `wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=<s> key=<pw>` / `start` / `stop hostednetwork` | `ssid`,`key` argv (netsh has no env channel — see residual) | hotspot |
| Mobile hotspot | `powershell` | fixed WinRT script (`-Command`) | SSID/pass ride **process ENV** (`$env:…`), never interpolated | hotspot (static + shape) |
| Elevation fact | `powershell` | fixed `PS_ELEV` script | none | hotspot |
| Reachability | `ping` | `-n/-c 1 -w/-W <t> <addr>` | `addr` — **IPv4-validated before spawn** | hostProbe |
| ELRS detect | `tasklist`/`pgrep` | `IMAGENAME eq <image>` / `-f <image>` | `image` = basename of configured path | elrsLauncher |
| ELRS launch | `<elrsPath>` | `[]`, detached, `stdio:'ignore'`, unref | `elrsPath` = executable (shell:false) | elrsLauncher, noControlPath |
| Timeout tree-kill | `taskkill` | `/pid <pid> /t /f` (`winTreeKillArgs`) | pid (own child) | runCommand, commandGeneration |
| mediamtx | bundled binary | `[configPath]` | none (fixed paths) | — (fixed) |
| fetch-mediamtx / ensure-electron | `tar`/`unzip` | fixed archive paths | none (pinned version, build-time) | — (build tooling, out of runtime threat surface) |

**Safety properties — verified:** executable+argv separation everywhere (`shell:false`
always — statically asserted no source sets `shell:true`); metacharacters inert (a behavioral
`runCommand` test proves `; && $() \`\` < > "` and spaces pass as single literal argv
elements); interface names and SSIDs with spaces stay one argv element; non-ASCII SSIDs +
passphrases round-trip verbatim through the utf8 temp file and into the connect argv;
XML-special SSID/password are escaped in the profile (`&<>"'` → entities) and pass raw-but-safe
in argv; open profile carries no key material; the passphrase never enters argv, the returned
error, logs, or a leftover file; out-of-scope SSID/security is rejected before any spawn (zero
processes, zero temp files); IPv4 is validated before ping spawns (injection-proof); missing
executable and wrapper-timeout keep stable `{ok:false, code:null,…}` shapes; `winTreeKillArgs`
emits `/t /f` (tree, force); localized output is never the basis of a security branch (B2/B4).

**Objective defects found + fixed (2):**
1. **Insecure temporary file (CWE-377), `main/wifiManager.js`.** The key-bearing WLAN profile
   was written to a **predictable** `w17-wlan-<Date.now()>.xml` in the shared tmpdir — a
   symlink/pre-creation race on the passphrase-carrying file and a same-millisecond collision
   under concurrent joins. **Fix:** a PRIVATE per-join `mkdtemp` directory (`w17-wlan-XXXX/`,
   0700, unpredictable) holds `profile.xml` (mode 0600); the WHOLE directory is removed in a
   `finally` after success AND failure. Cleanup-on-add-fail and cleanup-on-connect-fail are now
   explicitly tested; existing tests (which read the filename from argv) still pass.
2. **Untested tree-kill argv, `main/runCommand.js` (N4).** The `taskkill /t /f` args were
   inline and unverifiable without a real hung process. **Fix:** extracted to an exported pure
   `winTreeKillArgs(pid)`; behavior identical, now regression-tested.
   No `shell:true`, single-command-string, user-data-interpolation, credential-in-argv-log,
   missing-cleanup, or raw-error-to-UI defect was found in any other path.

**Accepted residuals (NOT defects; product/OS constraints — no change made):**
- Hosted-network `key=<pw>` rides netsh **argv** (visible briefly to a local `tasklist`/`wmic`).
  netsh `wlan set hostednetwork` has no env/stdin channel for the key, so there is no safer
  channel; the modern **mobile** backend (preferred) uses ENV and is the norm. Bench-only.
- The reachability probe stays ICMP by design (B4): no defensible TCP port for the UDP-5601 W2
  path; the phone screen is the final evidence.

**Tests added / changed:** `test/noControlPath.test.js` 10→**15** (sweep + discovery + narrow-
exception proofs; all semantic assertions preserved); new `test/commandGeneration.test.js`
**17** (shell:false invariant + metacharacter-inert behavioral; `winTreeKillArgs` + timeout/
missing-binary shapes; XML escaping incl. non-ASCII + all 5 metachars for WPA2 and open
profiles; wifiManager join with non-ASCII SSID, XML-special SSID, spaced SSID/adapter,
private-temp-dir + cleanup on success/add-fail/connect-fail, passphrase redaction, and
pre-spawn rejection of out-of-scope inputs). Existing command tests (wifiManager 36, hotspot
31, hostProbe 16, runCommand 4, elrsLauncher 6, wifiParse 39) already cover their per-module
D4 slices and stay green.

**Exact results (2026-07-13).** Syntax OK on all changed JS. Focused D1 **15/15**; focused D4
command surfaces (commandGeneration+wifiManager+runCommand+hotspot+hostProbe+elrsLauncher+
wifiParse) **149/149**; network/reachability + Batch C regressions (lifecycle/quit/reachability/
videoState/whep/setupFlowDom/wifiView/wifiSim) **175/175**; `noControlPath` **15/15**; full
suite `npm test` **542/542 (34 files)** (was 520/33 — +17 commandGeneration, +5 noControlPath);
`git diff --check` clean.

**Remaining real-Windows (bench) verification for D1/D4:** none for D1 (pure static guard,
platform-independent). For D4: on the Windows bench confirm `netsh wlan connect`/`add profile`
accept an SSID with spaces/quotes/`&`/non-ASCII as a single argv element (the fix relies on
argv-array quoting, believed correct, still bench-unverified — audit §1 context note); confirm
`taskkill /t /f` actually reaps a hung PowerShell tree (N4); confirm the mkdtemp profile path
is accepted by netsh `filename=`. Sim/dev-preview is never bench evidence.

**~~Exact D2 + D3 starting point~~ — D2 is now DONE (2026-07-14, see the Batch D2 status
section). Exact D3 starting point (NOT started):** a deterministic Electron boot smoke +
the smallest reliable Windows CI step. Design direction already scoped (and partially
seamed — `mediamtxPaths` honors `W17_MEDIAMTX_DIR` precisely so the smoke can exercise
the missing-mediamtx soft-fail with an empty dir): (a) `scripts/smokeMain.js`, an
Electron MAIN wrapper spawned as `electron scripts/smokeMain.js`, which sets a throwaway
`userData`, `require`s the real unmodified `main/main.js`, then interrogates the booted
app through public Electron APIs (window exists, did-finish-load, page-world
`typeof require/process === 'undefined'`, `Object.keys(window.groundStation)` equals the
preload parse, a real `getConfig()`/`getSettings()` answer with fresh-profile values and
no secret in effective metadata, GARAGE readiness marker, `window.open` returns null),
prints structured `W17_SMOKE` JSON lines, and quits — production files stay untouched;
(b) `scripts/electron-smoke.js`, a plain-Node controller that spawns it with a scrubbed
env (`W17_WIFI_SIM` set, telemetry/headtrack/bridge vars deleted, `W17_MEDIAMTX_DIR` →
empty temp dir), enforces a hard timeout with a process-TREE kill (reuse
`winTreeKillArgs`), requires result-ok AND clean exit 0, sanitizes captured logs, and
runs a second pass with a pre-seeded CORRUPT `settings.json` (malformed settings must
not blank the window); (c) vitest coverage of the CONTROLLER protocol with fake node
children (happy/failed-check/crash/hang-timeout-kill/no-clean-exit) so `npm test` stays
fast — the REAL smoke runs via a new `npm run smoke`; (d) CI: extend the existing
`package-smoke` windows-latest job to `npm ci → npm test → npm run smoke
(timeout-minutes) → app:rebuild → electron-builder --dir`; failure output prints the
sanitized log tail inline (no artifact plumbing exists in this workflow). Boot smoke
must not require camera/RT5370/iPhone/ELRS/admin/real hotspot/external network. Neither
D3 piece may touch control, W3 log-only, or the contract.

### B3 status: COMPLETE (code) — real netsh open/WPA3/enterprise behavior bench-pending

**Normalized security model** (`shared/wifiParse.js` `classifyWifiSecurity({auth,encryption})`).
Derived structurally from the netsh Authentication + Encryption fields; the renderer and
manager branch on the kind, never on localized prose (raw `auth`/`encryption` kept only as
diagnostics). Kinds and derivation:

| kind | derived when | join behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | auth matches a multi-locale open word (open/offen/ouvert/…) OR encryption is a none-word, and it is NOT WEP | OPEN NETWORK warning, no password; open profile installed if not saved |
| `wpa2-personal` | auth contains `wpa2` (no `wpa3`), not enterprise | WPA2-PSK: password required + WPA2 profile (unchanged) |
| `wpa2-wpa3-transition` | auth contains BOTH `wpa2` and `wpa3` | joinable **over WPA2** (password path, caution note) |
| `wpa3-only` | auth contains `wpa3` and NOT `wpa2` | **rejected** before any OS call (Q3 message) |
| `enterprise` | auth contains `enterprise`/`802.1x`/`eap` | **rejected** (clear unsupported message, no PSK prompt) |
| `unknown` | legacy WPA1, WEP, or anything unrecognized | **rejected** if NEW (`unsupported-unknown-security`, controlled message, NO WPA2 profile / NO speculative join); a network Windows already has a SAVED profile for joins via that profile (builds nothing) |

**Transition rule (documented):** a WPA2/WPA3 transition AP most commonly reports
Authentication `WPA2-Personal` (the mode Windows uses) → classified `wpa2-personal`
(joinable). A COMBINED token carrying both `WPA2` and `WPA3` → `wpa2-wpa3-transition`
(still joinable over WPA2). Only WPA3 **without** WPA2 is `wpa3-only` (rejected) — a
compatible WPA2 path is never called unsupported (Q3).

**Supported / unsupported matrix (implemented + tested):**

| network | offered? | join path |
|---|---|---|
| saved open | yes | connect via saved profile (no key, no profile install) |
| new open | yes | install open profile (`buildOpenWlanProfileXml`, no key) then connect; OPEN NETWORK/unencrypted warning |
| WPA2-PSK (new) | yes | password → WPA2 profile → connect (unchanged, adapter-pinned, temp file cleaned) |
| WPA2/WPA3 transition | yes | WPA2 password path + note |
| WPA3-only | **no** | `unsupported-wpa3` + "WPA3-only networks are not currently supported. Use a WPA2 network or start the W17 hotspot." |
| enterprise | **no** | `unsupported-enterprise` + clear unsupported message |
| hidden / empty / whitespace SSID | **no** | dropped from the scan; a join attempt → `unsupported-hidden-network` |
| unknown/unrecognized (NEW) | **no** | `unsupported-unknown-security` + "This network's security type could not be identified. Use a known WPA2 network or start the W17 hotspot." — NO password field, NO WPA2 profile, NO connect; sanitized raw auth/enc kept for a diagnostics tooltip only |
| unknown/unrecognized (SAVED profile) | yes | connect via the existing Windows profile (`known:true`), constructing nothing — the deliberate carve-out (tested both ways) |

**Profile generation.** `buildWlanProfileXml` (WPA2PSK/AES, key) and the new
`buildOpenWlanProfileXml` (authentication=open, encryption=none, NO `sharedKey`/`keyMaterial`).
Both XML-escape the SSID (and key) and are passed to netsh as argv `filename=<temp>`, never a
shell string; non-ASCII survives verbatim; temp file is deleted in a `finally` after success
AND failure. The passphrase rides the temp file only — never a netsh argument, log, error, or
snapshot (redaction asserted). `join()` guards run BEFORE any OS call, so an out-of-scope kind
never touches netsh (asserted zero-spawn).

### B4 status: COMPLETE (code) — real Windows ping behavior bench-pending

**Probe stays ICMP** (`main/hostProbe.js`); a TCP port was rejected — it would not test the
UDP-5601 W2 path the product cares about, and the phone screen is the final evidence.
`classifyPing(res, platform)` (pure, exported) classifies from stable structural signals:

- `reachable` ⇐ a `TTL=` echo reply (locale-neutral token) — the ONLY green.
- `unreachable` ⇐ a Windows **exit-0 reply without `TTL=`** (the audit-L4 "Destination host
  unreachable" false-green) OR a multi-locale unreachable phrase.
- `timeout` ⇐ no reply (a timeout phrase / 100%-loss marker), non-zero exit, no TTL.
- `invalid` ⇐ address fails IPv4 validation (no process spawned — injection-proof).
- `command-unavailable` ⇐ spawn failure (code null, not our timeout).
- `command-error` ⇐ our runCommand timeout (code null + `timeout after Nms`; A1/N4 tree-kill).
- `unknown` ⇐ ran, no structural signal — conservative red, never a confident green.

`probe()` returns `{ok, status, rttMs?|error}` (`.ok` backward-compatible; GRID + PIT WALL
callers updated). **Limitations:** ICMP proves the L3 path only; `unknown`/`timeout` differ
only by message (both red); phrase matching is best-effort corroboration on top of the
locale-neutral TTL/exit-code core. Real Windows ping output REQUIRES HARDWARE.

**Product truthfulness.** `shared/reachability.mjs` `PATH_ONLY_NOTE` is the exact decision-C4
wording; `probeStatusLine` keeps `reachable` at "network path only". A positive result never
claims UDP receipt, iOS permission, live W2 telemetry, or a working HUD (asserted). The PIT
WALL CHECK shows the honest per-status line and, on success only, the full path-only caveat.

### Batch C status: COMPLETE (code) — Electron dev-preview verified; real camera/network behavior bench-pending

Batch C hardens the *truthfulness* of runtime state + configuration UX. All four items done;
C4 was already realized in B4 and is re-validated below. Nothing here touches control, the W2
packet contract, or the W3 log-only path.

**C1 — video-state lifecycle (finding L3).** The old model was a single `videoPlaying` boolean:
true on the media `playing` event, cleared ONLY on `emptied`. A dying FPV stream fires
`waiting`/`stalled`, or the WebRTC peer connection silently goes `disconnected`/`failed` while
the `<video>` freezes on its last frame — none of which is `emptied` — so GRID VIDEO LOCK and W2
`video_lock` stayed confidently green between stream death and the WHEP reconnect.

- **`shared/videoState.mjs`** (pure, ESM, no DOM/IO): `reduceVideoState(state, event)` +
  `videoStatus(state)` + `videoLock(state)`. Phases: `idle`/`connecting`/`live`/`buffering`/
  `stalled`/`error`. `playing` is the ONLY confident-green (`live`) state; `waiting`→`buffering`,
  `stalled`/transport `dropped`→`stalled`, media `error`→`error`, `emptied`/`ended`/`stopped`→
  `idle`. Real frames (`playing`) override any prior stalled/buffering (ground truth); a stalled
  transport is not flapped back toward almost-live by a late `waiting`; a spurious `connecting`
  never overrides confirmed frames. Repeats return the SAME object (idempotent — no phantom
  re-render). Final view model:

  | phase | live (video_lock) | HUD label | tone | reconnecting |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `idle` | **false** | NO VIDEO | idle (dim) | no |
  | `connecting` | **false** | CONNECTING | wait | yes |
  | `live` | **true** | VIDEO LIVE | live (overlay hidden) | no |
  | `buffering` | **false** | BUFFERING | wait | yes |
  | `stalled` | **false** | STREAM STALLED | warn (amber) | yes |
  | `error` | **false** | VIDEO ERROR | error (red) | no |

- **`renderer/whep.js`**: added an `onStatus` callback (`connecting` at each (re)connect attempt,
  `dropped` when an ESTABLISHED peer connection fails/disconnects/closes, `stopped` on teardown)
  and a **stale-pc identity guard** — each attempt captures `const thisPc`, and its
  `onconnectionstatechange` acts only while `thisPc === pc`. This both fixes a latent bug (the old
  handler read the mutable closure `pc`, so a stale callback read the *new* attempt's state) and
  is the honest answer to "stale events from an earlier reconnect attempt must not overwrite a
  newer state": in a single renderer, media events are single-source ordered and transport
  callbacks are pc-identity-guarded, so no cross-source reorder exists to defend against. A WebRTC
  drop (which fires no media event) is what clears the green immediately.
- **`renderer/hud.js`**: one `videoState` authority; media listeners
  (`playing`/`waiting`/`stalled`/`emptied`/`ended`/`error`) attached unconditionally + the whep
  `onStatus` feed both go through `applyVideoEvent`. `#feedNoteText` shows the label and the
  overlay hides only when `live` (a frozen frame is labelled STREAM STALLED, never hidden).
  `hudStatus().videoPlaying` and the W2 mirror's `videoPlaying` are BOTH `videoStatus(state).live`
  — so GRID, HUD, and W2 read one authority and a frozen/reconnecting stream reports
  `video_lock:false`. Intentional pause does not exist in this app, so `pause`/`suspend` are not
  wired (no false red).
- Tests: `test/videoState.test.js` (16), `test/whep.test.js` (5, incl. the stale-pc race guard),
  `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` C1 block (2: feed-note follows media events; GRID VIDEO LOCK green
  on frames then NOT green after a `stalled` with no `emptied` — no stale green).

**C2 — replay chip (D1, decision Q4).** A compact persistent `TELEMETRY · REPLAY` chip in the HUD
session panel (`#replayChip`), violet — visually distinct from the amber W3 chip and the teal live
indicators. Rules (all tested): shown ONLY when the EFFECTIVE telemetry source is `replay`
(`config:get.telemetrySource` at HUD boot + `setReplayChip(applied.telemetry === 'replay')` after
every `applySession`, so a runtime ⚙ switch or env override is reflected immediately); hidden for
live/none/crsf-serial; **Wi-Fi simulation alone does NOT trigger it** (separate subsystem — the
PIT WALL `SIMULATED WIFI` tag is independent); replay + SIMULATED WIFI can show together; replay +
the W3 log-only chip are independent (both can show at once); not dismissible (a plain `<div>`, no
interactive control); screenshot-visible. `npm run demo` (`W17_TELEMETRY_SOURCE=replay`) shows it
and also env-locks the source (see C3).

**C3 — env-locked settings (D3, decision Q8).** `shared/envLocks.mjs` (pure) maps each lockable ⚙
control to its variable + accessible wording. `settings:get` now returns an `effective` block so
the ⚙ shows the EFFECTIVE value, not the ignored persisted one. Matrix (implemented + tested):

  | ⚙ control | env var | envOverridden key | presentation when locked | editable when unlocked |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Telemetry source (`<select>`) | `W17_TELEMETRY_SOURCE` | `telemetrySource` | **disabled**, shows effective source, amber ENV badge (focusable, names the var), `aria-describedby` | yes (unchanged) |
  | Telemetry port (`<input>`) | `W17_TELEMETRY_PORT` | `telemetryPort` | **readonly** (stays focusable + tooltip), shows effective port, ENV badge | yes |
  | Head-track logging (checkbox) | `W17_HEADTRACK` | `w3` | **disabled**, shows effective on/off, ENV badge | yes |
  | iPhone bridge (W2) | `W17_IPHONE_BRIDGE`(+ADDR/PORT/RATE) | `iphoneBridge` | no ⚙ control (driven by GARAGE mode + IP) — surfaced only via the GRID "LOCKED BY ENV VARS" radio line | n/a |

  A `<select>`/checkbox has no `readonly`, so it is `disabled` and the adjacent **focusable** ENV
  badge (`tabindex=0`, `role=note`, `title` + `aria-label`) carries the accessible name — Q8's
  "readonly + separate lock indicator where a disabled control blocks focus/tooltip". Force-off is
  honoured (e.g. `W17_HEADTRACK=0` → effective off, shown + locked). **Partial locks work**: only
  the overridden field is locked. **Locked edits are never persisted** — `telemetryChanged` builds
  a patch of only the UNLOCKED fields (so a locked source's displayed effective value is never
  written back), and the W3 change handler returns early when locked. No secret leakage: only the
  variable NAME is placed in a tooltip, never its value (asserted the port value is absent from the
  badge title); none of these variables carry a credential.

**C5 — W2 starts on GRID entry (D2, decision Q5) — documented, unchanged.** Re-validated the
implementation: `enterGrid()` (`renderer/setupFlow.js`) → `gs.applySession()` →
`main.js applySession()` → `runtime.applyConfig()` starts the W2 sender when
`effective.iphoneBridge` is set (iPhone Cockpit mode + a confirmed IPv4, OR `W17_IPHONE_BRIDGE`).
`applyConfig` is diff-aware/idempotent (keyed on `{...iphoneBridge, demo}`), so **repeated GRID
entry does not duplicate the sender**; a **changed target IP** changes the key → the old bridge is
stopped and a new one started. Leaving GRID does not tear W2 down (session-scoped; the quit path
and `will-quit` own teardown). **Desktop mode never starts W2** (`resolveEffective` sets
`iphoneBridge:null` unless `fpvMode==='iphone-hud'`). W2 forwards whatever telemetry source is
active (replay carries `mode:'demo'`; none → mirror-only). Errors: an `applySession` rejection
shows `SESSION APPLY FAILED`; W2 send failures are logged (send-only, fire-and-forget — the app
cannot know the phone received). No packet-shape or timing change. UI: a new `#gridNote` (iPhone
mode only) reads *"The iPhone HUD begins receiving telemetry on GRID so you can verify it before
START. Ping proves the network path only — live data visible on the iPhone is the final
evidence."* — Desktop mode shows no iPhone wording.

**C4 — reachability wording (V3) — re-validated, no change.** `PATH_ONLY_NOTE`
(`shared/reachability.mjs:13`) is byte-exact to the decision-C4 string; a reachable check reads
"REACHABLE … — network path only" + the full caveat; no status claims UDP receipt, iOS Local
Network permission, visible telemetry, or a working HUD (`test/reachability.test.js`,
`test/setupFlowDom.test.js` reachability block).

**Electron visual acceptance (real app, scratchpad harness, dev-preview only — NOT bench
evidence).** A hidden `BrowserWindow` loaded the REAL `renderer/index.html` + real CSS via an
injected mock preload (harness scratchpad-only, never committed), sampling `getComputedStyle`
(the reliable check for colour, per the tooling guidance) + screenshots. Confirmed: **C1** feed
note idle `NO VIDEO`→`VIDEO LIVE` (overlay hidden)→`BUFFERING`→`STREAM STALLED` (amber
`rgb(255,178,0)`)→`VIDEO ERROR` (red `rgb(255,45,45)`)→`NO VIDEO`→reconnect `VIDEO LIVE`; **C2**
replay chip visible violet `rgb(185,139,255)` with the W3 chip amber alongside (independent),
hidden for source `none`, and **hidden under Wi-Fi-sim-only on PIT WALL while `SIMULATED WIFI`
shows**; **C3** all-locked ⚙ → source disabled=`replay`, port readonly=`9999`, w3 disabled+checked,
amber ENV badges with var-naming tooltips; no-override ⚙ → all editable, badges hidden; **C5**
iPhone GRID shows the note, Desktop GRID hides it. No layout regression.

**Bench-pending (real hardware).** Real camera → mediamtx → WHEP so the video-state model runs
against genuine WebRTC drops/stalls (H1 A1 fix + H.264 check territory); real iPhone confirming W2
telemetry appears on GRID (C5) and that the reachability path-only caveat holds. Sim/dev-preview
is never bench evidence.

### B1 + B2 + N3 status: COMPLETE (code) — real WinRT/netsh/localized-Windows behavior bench-pending

**Lifecycle authority.** `main/hotspotLifecycle.js` is the ONE runtime authority (main
process). It wraps `HotspotManager` (which stays the OWNERSHIP truth — `manager.active()`
= the backend this app started, never an external hotspot) and layers the phase model
INACTIVE→STARTING→LIVE→STOPPING. Snapshots carry `{seq, phase, owned, backend, ssid,
hostIp, lastError, probe}`. The renderer MIRRORS snapshots (pull on PIT WALL entry +
`hotspot-state` pushes) and never infers state from the DOM; both paths pass through one
`adoptHotspotSnap` gate. Duplicate start/stop are suppressed at the authority
(`kind:'busy'`) and the DOM disables conflicting controls as a second layer, never the
enforcement point.

**Sequence/adoption contract (the race fix).** Electron does not guarantee push arrival
order. `_emit()` bumps a monotonic `_seq`; `snapshot()` reports it; the renderer holds the
highest adopted seq and drops any `snap.seq < heldSeq`. Equal seq re-renders idempotently;
a missing seq (legacy shape) is adopted last-writer-wins; the renderer never mints a seq;
the initial state is `seq:0` and any real change is `≥1`. This is proven at both the
authority level (strictly increasing seq across start→live→stop) and the renderer level
(9 race cases, push and pull, in `test/setupFlowDom.test.js`).

**Ownership matrix (implemented + tested):**

| Path | App owns hotspot? | Where enforced / tested |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile start success | **Yes** | `hotspot.js` sets `_activeBackend='mobile'`; lifecycle → LIVE. `hotspot.test.js`, `hotspotLifecycle.test.js` |
| Hosted start success | **Yes** | `_activeBackend='hosted'`; lifecycle → LIVE |
| Configuration failure before start | **No** | password/SSID gate returns `config-failed` with zero OS calls; lifecycle → INACTIVE + error |
| External hotspot already running (`START_ALREADY_ON`) | **No** | `fallback:false`, ownership never set; lifecycle → INACTIVE; probe `externallyActive:true` shown, never owned |
| Mobile config mismatch after partial start | **Yes** | `START_CONFIG_MISMATCH` keeps `_activeBackend`; lifecycle → LIVE + error, ssid withheld, STOP/retry offered |
| Mobile start status failure, no confirmed start | **No** | `start-failed`/`ps-error`, ownership unset; lifecycle → INACTIVE |
| Stop success | **No** | `_activeBackend` cleared AFTER success (N2); lifecycle → INACTIVE |
| Stop failure | **Yes** | ownership retained (N2); lifecycle → LIVE + `stop-failed`, STOP retry enabled |
| Leave running and quit | Hotspot remains active; process exits | quit policy LEAVE RUNNING → `quit()`, no stop call |
| Cancel quit | Unchanged | quit policy CANCEL → `stay`, state untouched |
| Failed stop during quit | **Yes**; app stays open | quit policy STOP AND QUIT → stop fails → `showError` + `stay` |

**Quit-policy matrix (`main/quitPolicy.js`, tested in `test/quitPolicy.test.js`):**

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|
| INACTIVE hotspot | no `preventDefault`, no dialog — quit proceeds |
| Externally-active / not owned | no dialog — quit proceeds |
| App-owned LIVE | dialog shown once (STOP AND QUIT / LEAVE RUNNING / CANCEL) |
| STOP AND QUIT, stop OK | waits for stop success, then `quit()` |
| STOP AND QUIT, stop fails | `showError`, app stays open, hotspot still owned + LIVE, later quit re-asks |
| LEAVE RUNNING | `quit()` without stopping |
| CANCEL | no quit, state unchanged, later quit re-asks |
| Repeated quit while dialog open | absorbed — one dialog, one decision |
| Quit during STARTING | `whenSettled()` waits; settled-LIVE → ask, settled-failed → quit silently |
| Quit during STOPPING | `whenSettled()` waits; stop-OK → quit silently, stop-fail → ask |
| Policy-issued `quit()` re-enters before-quit | `allowQuit` latch → passes straight through, no recursion |
| Dialog backend throws | fail-open: `quit()` (never unquittable) |

**N3 probe.** `wifi:capabilities` no longer probes (instant platform+sim answer). The
WinRT probe is `wifi:hotspot-probe` through the lifecycle: cached, single-flight
(concurrent callers share one PowerShell run), `{refresh:true}` re-probe (the pane's
RECHECK), emits `probe:'probing'` immediately, and turns a rejection into a controlled
`{status:'failed'}`. The renderer renders PIT WALL before the probe resolves; a stale
probe completion after nav-away is dropped by the epoch guard AND the seq gate. States
distinguished: probing / supported / unsupported / failed / externally-active. Hotspot
capability is NOT conflated with WLAN adapter availability (netsh-fail sim: `READY —
hosted backend` while the adapter card shows `ADAPTER CHECK FAILED`).

**B2 locale-neutral errors.** The `/denied|elevat|administrator/` regex is gone. A hosted
start failure is `kind:'start-failed'`, `backend:'hosted'`, with the raw netsh detail
sanitized+retained; the administrator line is a `suggestion` gated on the locale-neutral
`PS_ELEV` token (`WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole` → `ELEV_ADMIN`/`ELEV_LIMITED`/`ELEV_ERROR`):
shown when not elevated OR unknown, suppressed when elevated — never asserted as the
definite cause. Mobile failures carry `backend:'mobile'`; a failed hosted fallback keeps
the superseded mobile failure as `fallbackFrom` (A1 fallback rules intact). EN and DE
hosted-failure fixtures classify identically. No credential reaches any error, log,
snapshot, or test (redaction asserted).

**Tests + results (2026-07-13).** Syntax OK on every changed JS/MJS file. Focused:
`hotspot` 31, `wifiSim` 14, `hotspotLifecycle` 26, `quitPolicy` 13, `wifiView` 25,
`setupFlowDom` 31, `noControlPath` 10 — all green. Full B1/B2 + A1–A3 regression set
(11 files) **214/214**. Full suite `npm test` **407/407** (29 files, was 331/27).
`git diff --check` clean. Electron sim acceptance (scratchpad harness, dev-preview only):
two-adapters full lifecycle + netsh-fail failure/RECHECK verified, sequence race
reproduced-then-fixed, LIVE/after-STOP/failure screenshots visually confirmed.

**Bench-pending (real Windows).** Real WinRT tethering start/stop tokens; real
`WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole` under an actual elevated vs limited process; real localized
netsh hostednetwork failure text; the Electron quit dialog on a real close; and that the
`hotspot-state` push ordering hazard behaves as modelled on the target machine (the seq
guard is defensive regardless). Sim is never bench evidence.

### A1 verification status: INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED (cross-account session, 2026-07-12)

A fresh session re-read every A1 file skeptically and reproduced all checkpoint numbers
(syntax OK ×4; focused 48/48; full 280/280 pre-A2). No debris, duplicates, unreachable
branches, token collisions, unsafe fallbacks, ownership faults, or credential leaks
found; no changes made to A1 code. WinRT behavior remains bench-pending as documented.

### A1 implementation status: COMPLETE (code) — WinRT behavior bench-pending

What changed, file by file:

**`main/hotspot.js` (rewritten).** Replaced the three PowerShell scripts and the start/stop
control flow. Key points:
- New `PS_COMMON` prologue used by all three scripts: `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`;
  `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime` (the AsTask extension methods are
  NOT loaded by default in a fresh `-NoProfile` PS 5.1 session — this was the primary H1
  bug); explicit type loads for the WinRT namespaces; `GetInternetConnectionProfile()` →
  `RESULT_NO_PROFILE` (exit 2) when there is no tetherable profile; whole prologue wrapped
  in try/catch → `RESULT_SETUP_ERROR` (exit 1).
- TWO awaiters: `Await` for `IAsyncOperation`1` (StartTethering/StopTethering results) and
  `AwaitAction` for `IAsyncAction` (ConfigureAccessPointAsync — the second H1 bug: it
  returns IAsyncAction, not IAsyncOperation, so the old single awaiter threw).
- `PS_START` ordering is fail-closed: if already `On` → `START_ALREADY_ON` (exit 5); configure
  in try/catch → on failure `START_CONFIG_FAILED` (exit 3) and **exits before**
  `StartTetheringAsync` is ever invoked (this is what prevented the old script from
  half-starting tethering with the OLD Windows SSID/password); start in try/catch →
  `START_ERROR` (exit 1) / `START_FAILED_<status>` (exit 4); then a **readback**:
  re-reads `GetCurrentAccessPointConfiguration().Ssid` and, if it ≠ requested,
  `START_CONFIG_MISMATCH` (exit 6); only then `START_OK`.
- `PS_STOP` → `STOP_OK` / `STOP_ERROR` / `STOP_FAILED_<status>`.
- Scripts are single-quote-only (no `"` chars) so spawn argv can't corrupt them; SSID/pass
  ride process ENV (`$env:W17_HOTSPOT_SSID` / `$env:W17_HOTSPOT_PASS`), never interpolated.
- `PS_SCRIPTS = {probe,start,stop}` is now exported (for static tests + the diag tool).
- `probeBackends()` now keys mobile on `PROBE_OK` (was `TETHER_OK`), and adds a
  diagnostic `mobileState` field (WinRT `TetheringOperationalState`: On/Off/InTransition/…).
- `start()` returns structured failures with `kind` and an internal `fallback` flag; see
  vocabulary + fallback rules below. Added `active()` → the backend WE started, or null
  (the B1 quit-dialog gate; ownership never covers externally-started hotspots).
- `stop()` (N2 fix): clears `_activeBackend` only AFTER success; a failed stop keeps
  ownership and returns `{ok:false, kind:'stop-failed', backend, error}`.
- `failDetail()` caps error text at 300 chars and never includes the password.

**`main/runCommand.js` (N4).** On the timeout path, win32 now runs
`taskkill /pid <pid> /t /f` (whole tree), with `.on('error')` fallback to `child.kill()`;
non-win32 still uses `child.kill()`. Result shape unchanged
(`{ok:false, code:null, stderr:'timeout after <ms>ms'}`).

**`main/wifiSim.js`.** PowerShell branch updated to the new tokens so
`W17_WIFI_SIM` previews still exercise the real manager: no-adapter/netsh-fail →
`{ok:false, code:2, stdout:'RESULT_NO_PROFILE'}`; start script → `START_OK`; stop script →
`STOP_OK`; otherwise (probe) → `PROBE_STATE_Off\nPROBE_OK`.

**`test/hotspot.test.js` (rewritten, 10→23 tests).** Router matches scripts by unique
markers (`StartTetheringAsync`, `StopTetheringAsync`, `PROBE_OK`). Covers: probe
mobile/hosted/neither + `mobileState`; start success + ENV-not-text + ownership;
`START_ALREADY_ON` (no ownership, no fallback); `START_CONFIG_MISMATCH` (ownership kept,
no fallback); config-failure→hosted fallback; config-failure w/o hosted surfaces mobile
failure; elevation; unsupported; password never echoed. Stop: no-op; success clears
ownership; **failed stop retains ownership**; STOP_OK gating. Plus a
`fail-closed PowerShell structure` block (static assertions over `PS_SCRIPTS`): Add-Type,
both awaiters, AwaitAction-on-Configure, exit-3-before-Start, START_OK-after-readback,
env-only + no-double-quotes.

**`test/runCommand.test.js` (new, 4 tests).** Real spawns of `process.execPath`: success
stdout; missing binary → ok:false (never throws); 200ms timeout over a 10s sleep →
ok:false + `timeout` reason (exercises the N4 path shape cross-platform); additive env.

**`scripts/hotspot-diag.js` (new).** Windows-only bench tool that runs the ACTUAL
`PS_SCRIPTS` via `runCommand` and prints raw stdout/stderr + interpretation.
`node scripts/hotspot-diag.js` = probe only (safe); `--start "SSID" "pw"` = configure+start
(no auto-stop; reminds operator to verify SSID on a phone then `--stop`); `--stop` = stop.
Never persists/prints the password.

### PowerShell token / result vocabulary (stdout)

`RESULT_NO_PROFILE` (exit 2, no tetherable profile) · `RESULT_SETUP_ERROR <msg>` (exit 1,
prologue threw) · `PROBE_STATE_<state>` + `PROBE_OK` (probe healthy) ·
`START_ALREADY_ON` (exit 5) · `START_CONFIG_FAILED <msg>` (exit 3) · `START_ERROR <msg>`
(exit 1) · `START_FAILED_<status> <msg>` (exit 4) · `START_CONFIG_MISMATCH` (exit 6) ·
`START_OK` · `STOP_ERROR <msg>` (exit 1) · `STOP_FAILED_<status>` (exit 4) · `STOP_OK`.

Manager `start()` result `kind` values: `config-failed`, `start-failed`, `already-on`,
`config-mismatch`, `no-profile`, `ps-error`, `needs-elevation`, `unsupported`; `stop()`
failure `kind`: `stop-failed`.

### Fallback rules (mobile → hosted)

`start()` probes, and if `mobile` is available tries `_start_mobile`. It falls back to
hostednetwork ONLY when the mobile result has `fallback !== false` AND `probe.hosted`.
`fallback:false` (never fall back) is set for `already-on` (someone else's hotspot — do
not stack a second network) and `config-mismatch` (we started it; needs an explicit STOP,
not a second backend). `config-failed`/`no-profile`/`start-failed`/`ps-error` have
`fallback:true`; with no hosted backend they surface the real mobile failure instead of a
misleading hosted error.

### Hotspot ownership rules

`_activeBackend` = the backend this app successfully started (`'mobile'`/`'hosted'`), else
null; exposed via `active()`. Set on `START_OK` (mobile) / hosted start success, and also
on `START_CONFIG_MISMATCH` (we did start tethering, just with the wrong SSID — keep it so
the UI can STOP it). NOT set on `already-on` (not ours). Cleared only after a successful
`stop()`. `stop()` is a no-op when `active()` is null → the app never stops a hotspot it
did not start (Q1/Q2 requirement).

### Tests: exact commands + results

- Syntax checks (all passed):
  `node -c main/hotspot.js && node -c main/wifiSim.js && node -c main/runCommand.js && node -c scripts/hotspot-diag.js` → "SYNTAX OK (all 4)".
- Focused:
  `npx vitest run test/hotspot.test.js test/wifiSim.test.js test/runCommand.test.js test/noControlPath.test.js`
  → **48/48 passed** (hotspot 23, wifiSim 11, runCommand 4, noControlPath 10).
- Full suite: `npm test` (→ `vitest run`) → **280/280 passed, 25 files** (was 263/24;
  +13 hotspot, +4 runCommand). No failures, no skips.
- Extra validation: dumped the generated `PS_SCRIPTS.start` and confirmed Add-Type,
  literal `IAsyncOperation`1`, AwaitAction-on-Configure, exit-3-before-Start,
  START_OK-after-mismatch, and zero double-quote chars.

### Remaining Windows-only verification for A1 (bench)

Real WinRT behavior is NOT proven by the mocked tests. On the Windows bench host run
`scripts/hotspot-diag.js` and checklist §3: (1) probe reports `PROBE_OK` +
`PROBE_STATE_Off`; (2) `--start "W17-GRID" "<8+char>"` prints `START_OK` and the SSID is
actually visible/joinable on a phone (this is the exact H1 regression to confirm); (3)
`--stop` prints `STOP_OK`; (4) with no tetherable profile → `RESULT_NO_PROFILE` then the
app falls back to hostednetwork; (5) non-elevated hostednetwork → elevation message.
Confirm the taskkill tree-kill (N4) actually reaps a hung PowerShell on Windows.

### Unresolved risks / uncertainties

- The `AwaitAction` reflection assumes the non-generic `AsTask(IAsyncAction)` overload
  exists and is found by the `Where-Object` filter (`-not $_.IsGenericMethod` +
  `ParameterType.Name -eq 'IAsyncAction'`). High-confidence per docs; bench-confirm.
- `START_CONFIG_MISMATCH` assumes `GetCurrentAccessPointConfiguration()` reflects the
  applied SSID synchronously after start; if Windows lags, a real success could read as a
  mismatch. Bench-observe; acceptable (fails safe toward "press STOP and retry").
- `probeBackends()` still awaits the 20s-timeout WinRT probe before PIT WALL renders
  (N3) — unchanged in A1, deferred to B1.

### Approved product decisions (Q1–Q8, C4) — full text in §4

- Q1 quit policy: **ask on quit, only when the app owns an active hotspot** (STOP HOTSPOT
  AND QUIT / LEAVE HOTSPOT RUNNING / CANCEL); never for externally-started hotspots.
- Q2 STOP button: INACTIVE→STARTING→LIVE→STOPPING + actionable ERROR; STOP beside START;
  disable conflicting actions during transitions; no duplicate requests; failed stop keeps
  LIVE + retains ownership + allows retry; never stop external hotspots; N2 fixed.
- Q3 Wi-Fi scope: support saved AND new **open** networks (OPEN NETWORK warning, no pw
  field); **reject WPA3-only** ("WPA3-only networks are not currently supported. Use a WPA2
  network or start the W17 hotspot."); skip malformed/empty SSIDs; hidden networks →
  clear unsupported message (not raw netsh error); add escaping tests.
- Q4 replay marking: compact persistent `TELEMETRY · REPLAY` chip in the HUD session panel
  while replay is active; not dismissible; screenshot-visible; keep SIMULATED WIFI
  separate; no watermark.
- Q5 W2 timing: keep GRID-entry start, document it (preflight evidence; ping proves path
  only; live phone data is the real evidence; START begins the driving session); no new
  packet type.
- Q6 credentials: safeStorage/DPAPI encryption; transparent plaintext→encrypted migration;
  ciphertext incl. `.bak`; **no persistent-plaintext fallback** — when OS encryption
  unavailable keep in memory for the session only + warn; undecryptable secret (foreign
  account/machine) → no crash, clear/ignore, re-request, preserve other settings; never
  log/expose credentials; redaction tests.
- Q7 adapter UX: always show an ADAPTER section in PIT WALL (Win: 0/1/2/saved-missing
  states, styled card + obvious dropdown; guide mode: section with "available in the
  Windows application" + W17_WIFI_SIM hint, never present host interfaces as adapters; sim:
  deterministic 0/1/2 scenarios). Verify the actual launch path first; show revised design
  before a substantial visual redesign — objective visibility/error fixes may proceed.
- Q8 env-lock: disabled control + amber ENV tag + effective value + tooltip naming the var
  + explanation; keep readable/accessible (readonly + adjacent lock indicator where a
  disabled native control blocks focus/tooltip).
- C4 wording: "Ping succeeded. This proves the network path only. Confirm live data on the
  iPhone; check iOS Local Network permission if it does not appear." (longer text →
  checklist/tooltip).

### A2 implementation status: COMPLETE (M1 + N1)

What changed, file by file:

**`shared/keyboardFocus.mjs` (new).** Pure ESM focus policy, no DOM dependency at
import: `isEditableTarget` (input/select/textarea + contenteditable incl. attribute
variants and nesting via `closest`), `isInteractiveTarget` (editable + button/a/summary
native activation), `makeHudKeyHandlers(keys)` (keydown: editable target → record
nothing, prevent nothing; else record; claim arrows/space with preventDefault except
space on an interactive target — space is a button's activation key; keyup: ALWAYS
clears so a key released inside a field never sticks down), `makeEnterToAdvance`
(Enter advances only from a non-interactive focus and only when `canAdvance()`),
`makeEnterToSubmit` (field-level Enter → preventDefault + submit). Listed in the
noControlPath `setupFlowFiles` guard.

**`renderer/hud.js`.** The window `keydown`/`keyup` handlers are now
`makeHudKeyHandlers(keys)` — typing in any field is no longer recorded into the HUD
mirror nor preventDefault-ed; keyboard driving still works from body/button focus.
`init()` (N1): `getConfig` and `getSettings` guarded separately — config failure falls
back to built-in feel constants and skips WHEP; settings failure keeps the default
controller; both log `console.error`, HUD keeps running.

**`renderer/setupFlow.js`.** Enter-nav is `makeEnterToAdvance` (same gate/nav
visibility conditions as before); `netPassword` gets `makeEnterToSubmit(doJoin)` —
Enter in the Wi-Fi password field JOINS and never navigates. N1: new narrow `ipc()`
guard (one IPC call per use; logs the real error once per channel; returns a FIXED
credential-free fallback). Wrapped: `wifi:capabilities` (fail → guide mode + radio
notice, not silent), `wifi:interfaces` (fail → wifiView 'failed' row, RESCAN retries),
`wifi:scan` (fail → 'SCAN FAILED — scan did not complete — RESCAN to retry'),
`wifi:join` + `wifi:hotspot-start` (fixed messages, `detail:false` withholds raw error
from the log since args carry credentials; JOIN/START retryable), `wifi:status`
(distinct 'WIFI CHECK FAILED' vs 'not detected'), `setup:addr-hint` (background poll →
no suggestion), `setup:probe-host` (both call sites), `elrs:status` (fail → red row,
never skipped/green), `elrs:launch`, `session:apply` (GRID entry → visible 'SESSION
APPLY FAILED' summary + radio + honest checklist; ⚙ handlers → 'APPLY FAILED — …
retry' status). `save()` catches `settings:set`, keeps in-memory settings, warns
'SETTINGS SAVE FAILED — CHANGES MAY NOT PERSIST' on team radio (fixed text; the patch
can carry the hotspot password). `boot()` failure shows `#bootError` + RETRY (re-runs
boot) instead of a blank gate.

**`renderer/index.html` + `renderer/hud.css`.** New `#bootError` block (SETUP DATA
UNAVAILABLE + `#bootRetry`) inside the gate, `.booterror` styles.

**`package.json` / `package-lock.json`.** `jsdom` devDependency (the D2 DOM-harness
prerequisite, pulled forward with user-instruction backing; vitest per-file
`@vitest-environment jsdom` pragma — node stays the default env).

**`test/keyboardFocus.test.js` (new, 16 tests, jsdom).** Predicates (all tags,
contenteditable variants incl. `"false"` and nesting) + real-KeyboardEvent handler
tests: space/arrows in input/select/contenteditable not prevented and not recorded;
body arrows/space claimed + recorded; button keeps native space, arrows still drive;
keyup always clears; Enter-advance blocked from every editable/interactive focus,
works from body, respects `canAdvance`; password-field Enter submits once, never
advances.

**`test/setupFlowDom.test.js` (new, 8 tests, jsdom).** REAL `renderer/index.html` +
real `setupFlow.js`/`hud.js` with a mocked `window.groundStation`: boot rejection →
visible `#bootError`, RETRY recovers to GARAGE; space/arrow/Enter end-to-end in the
password field (JOIN called with typed password incl. space, step unchanged); Enter in
`iphoneAddr` doesn't navigate, Enter on body does; join rejection → fixed message,
password absent from UI text AND console.error output, retry works; scan rejection →
SCAN FAILED + RESCAN recovers; hotspot rejection → fixed message, password absent from
status and log; save rejection → radio warning, flow continues; GRID `session:apply`
rejection → visible summary error, checklist still renders. Unhandled rejections
anywhere in these flows would fail the file (vitest surfaces them).

### A2 tests: exact commands + results

- Syntax: `node --check renderer/hud.js renderer/setupFlow.js` (plus the four A1 files) — OK.
- Focused (A2 + A1 regression + guards):
  `npx vitest run test/keyboardFocus.test.js test/setupFlowDom.test.js test/hotspot.test.js test/wifiSim.test.js test/runCommand.test.js test/noControlPath.test.js`
  → **72/72 passed** (keyboardFocus 16, setupFlowDom 8, hotspot 23, wifiSim 11,
  runCommand 4, noControlPath 10).
- Full suite: `npm test` → **304/304 passed, 27 files** (was 280/25; +16 keyboardFocus,
  +8 setupFlowDom). `git diff --check` clean.

### A2 remaining limitations

- jsdom cannot prove real Chromium focus/IME behavior; a quick manual bench pass over
  the PIT WALL fields (space in SSID/password, arrows, Enter-joins) is listed for the
  Windows bench visit. No dedicated bench checklist item added yet (fold into D3/F).
- `main.js` is still untested (V2) and `wifi:capabilities` can still block PIT WALL
  entry for up to 20 s (N3, deferred to B1). The boot-error state covers `settings:get`
  rejection, not a main-process crash (Electron-level, out of renderer reach).
- The `ipc()` guard logs once per channel per session (deliberate: 1–2 s pollers would
  flood the console); subsequent distinct errors on the same channel are visible only
  through the UI state.

### A3 implementation status: COMPLETE (M2 code fix + objective UI fixes) — netsh/RT5370 behavior bench-pending

What changed, file by file:

**`shared/wifiParse.js`.** The merged `parseNetshInterfaces` (whole-output scan: last
SSID won, first % won — the M2 root cause) is **deleted**, with a comment explaining
why it must not come back. Adapter status has exactly one path now:
`parseNetshInterfacesList` (per-adapter blocks; name = first field, description =
second, connectedness = non-empty literal-`SSID` value in the SAME block, signal = the
block's own %). No other production code imported the merged parser (grep-verified),
so nothing can call it accidentally — the "constrain or deprecate" requirement is met
by removal.

**`main/wifiManager.js`.**
- `status({iface} = {})`: with `iface`, every connection field comes from that
  adapter's own parsed block; a missing adapter returns
  `{ok:true, iface, present:false, connected:false, ssid:'', signalPct:null, error:'adapter "X" not detected'}`
  (adapter-specific, never another adapter's status); a failed netsh run now returns
  `{ok:false, …, error}` instead of silently claiming "not connected". Without
  `iface`, the aggregate answer is the FIRST CONNECTED block as a unit (ssid+signal
  always from one adapter) — single-adapter behavior unchanged (verified against the
  original fixture: same connected/ssid/signalPct).
- `join({ssid, password, iface})`: profile-add and connect were already pinned via
  `interface=`; verification now polls `status({iface})`. Success = pinned block
  `connected && ssid === requested` (exact, case-sensitive — the target string comes
  from the same netsh scan output; a differently-cased SSID is a different network).
  Poll cadence unchanged: 1 s × 20 s deadline (`JOIN_POLL_MS`/`JOIN_TIMEOUT_MS`,
  tested = exactly 20 polls via the injected sleep/fake clock, NOT by shrinking the
  timeout). A transitional block (associating, no SSID line yet) simply reads as
  not-connected-yet and polling continues. An adapter that disappears mid-poll keeps
  being polled (USB re-enumeration can bring it back) and the timeout error is built
  from the LAST poll only — no stale earlier state can leak: `_joinTimeoutError`
  distinguishes (a) status check itself failing (`could not verify the join to X: <reason>`),
  (b) pinned adapter missing (`adapter "X" not detected after 20s — reconnect it and RESCAN`),
  (c) plain not-connected (`not connected to X on adapter "Y" after 20s (adapter is
  not connected / currently connected to Z)`). No silent fallback to another adapter
  anywhere. `add profile`/`connect` failures now go through the 200-char-capped
  `failReason` like every other error.

**`main/wifiSim.js`.** The sim now tracks the joined SSID **per adapter** (`joined`
map; `wlan connect … interface=X` connects adapter X, default = first adapter;
unknown interface fails like netsh). Built-in and dongle carry distinct deterministic
signals (90% / 72%). `W17_WIFI_SIM=two-adapters` therefore demonstrates real
selection: joining on the dongle leaves the built-in on PaddockNet — the exact M2
topology, previewable on any OS. Still PREVIEW ONLY, never bench evidence.

**`shared/wifiView.mjs`.**
- `ifaceLabel` now appends the signal (`Wi-Fi — Intel … · PaddockNet · 90%`) — SSID
  and signal are fields of the same parsed adapter object by construction.
- Saved adapter NOT detected (any adapter count ≥ 1): mode `select` with a **disabled
  `"<saved> — NOT DETECTED"` placeholder**, `selected:''`, and a hint to choose an
  available adapter or reconnect + RESCAN. The previous silent fallback to the first
  adapter is gone (with one remaining adapter it previously silently switched to it —
  that could have joined W17-GRID on the built-in and killed its home/camera link).
- New `guide` state (`adapterRowState({guide:true})`): "Adapter selection is available
  in the Windows application." + a `W17_WIFI_SIM` dev hint.

**`renderer/setupFlow.js`.** ADAPTER row is now ALWAYS rendered on PIT WALL (guide
mode included); `adapterUnresolved()` blocks scan AND join with
`SELECT AN ADAPTER — the saved adapter was not detected` while the placeholder is
active (no netsh-default fallback the user never chose); picker options honor
`disabled`; guide-mode VERIFY treats `st.ok === false` (manager-reported netsh
failure) as `WIFI CHECK FAILED — VERIFY to retry`, distinct from "not detected".

**`renderer/hud.css`.** One objective line: `select` joined the `:focus` teal-border
rule (keyboard focus was invisible on the adapter picker; A2 made keyboard interaction
first-class). No other visual change — the Q7 redesign stays proposal-gated.

**Fixtures (new).** `netsh_interfaces_two_both_en.txt` (built-in HOME/84% first,
RT5370 W17-GRID/66% second), `…_two_both_reversed_en.txt` (identical blocks, dongle
first), `…_two_de.txt` (German labels, names with spaces — structural parsing proof),
`…_dongle_connecting_en.txt` (built-in connected; dongle `authenticating`, no SSID).

**Tests.** `wifiParse` 18 (both orders → same per-adapter objects; DE; spaces;
transitional; garbage), `wifiManager` 26 (pinned status both orders; missing adapter;
ok:false on netsh failure; aggregate coherence; pinned join success in both orders;
other-adapter-on-target can't fake success; transitional polling; disappearing
adapter honest from last poll with no stale/cross-adapter text; case-sensitivity;
could-not-verify; 20-poll cadence; all pre-existing tests preserved — inline netsh
texts upgraded to realistic full blocks), `wifiView` 12 (NOT DETECTED placeholder,
single-remaining-adapter still demands choice, guide state, signal-in-label),
`wifiSim` 13 (pinned dongle join leaves built-in untouched; unknown interface fails),
`setupFlowDom` 12 (guide-mode row, saved-missing blocks scan/join until picked, picker
pins scan+join, failed-listing row). `noControlPath` untouched and green.

### A3 test commands + results (2026-07-12)

- Syntax: `node --check` on `shared/wifiParse.js`, `main/wifiManager.js`,
  `main/wifiSim.js`, `renderer/setupFlow.js`, `shared/wifiView.mjs` — OK (all 5).
- Focused A3:
  `npx vitest run test/wifiParse.test.js test/wifiManager.test.js test/wifiView.test.js test/wifiSim.test.js test/setupFlowDom.test.js`
  → **81/81 passed**.
- A1/A2 regression + guards:
  `npx vitest run test/hotspot.test.js test/keyboardFocus.test.js test/runCommand.test.js test/noControlPath.test.js`
  → **53/53 passed**.
- Full suite: `npm test` → **327/327 passed, 27 files** (was 304; +3 wifiParse,
  +12 wifiManager, +4 wifiView, +2 wifiSim, +4 setupFlowDom — net of the 2 removed
  merged-parser tests). `git diff --check` clean.
- Handoff verification at session start reproduced the A2 checkpoint (72/72 focused).

### A3 remaining limitations / bench items

- Real `netsh wlan show interfaces` output with the RT5370 attached (block shape,
  transitional-state wording, whether an SSID line appears during association — if it
  does, a pinned join may read "connected" moments before DHCP completes; fails safe
  toward success-with-late-IP, observe on bench) — checklist §2/§6 territory.
- Whether `netsh wlan connect interface=…` accepts the parsed `Name` values verbatim
  on a real localized Windows (argv arrays are quoting-safe; the name string itself is
  bench-checked).
- The German fixture proves the PARSER's structural strategy; real German netsh
  output should be captured once on bench if a localized machine is available.
- jsdom previews prove renderer wiring, not Chromium rendering; eyeball the four sim
  scenarios once (`W17_WIFI_SIM=… npm start`).

### Adapter-UI investigation (Q7) — findings

**Exact conditions for the ADAPTER section to appear (pre-A3 tree):**
1. GARAGE choice = IPHONE COCKPIT (`iphone-hud`) — PIT WALL does not exist in the
   solo/desktop flow at all (`shared/setupSteps.mjs`).
2. AND not skipped: with `setupCompleted:true` persisted, boot() jumps STRAIGHT TO
   GRID ("WELCOME BACK") — PIT WALL is only reachable again via CHANGE SETUP → GARAGE.
3. AND `caps.canScan` true — i.e. real Windows, or any OS with `W17_WIFI_SIM` set
   (main.js forces the sim managers + platform win32). On macOS/Linux WITHOUT the sim
   the entire row was `hidden` (guide mode had no adapter section) — **fixed in A3**.
4. The row itself: one adapter = plain readonly text span; 2+ = native `<select>`
   (dark background, 1 px panel-edge border, mono font, OS-native chevron; no hover
   state; focus border was missing until the A3 one-liner); zero adapters / listing
   failure = amber warning text + hint line.

**Per-scenario behavior (from code + jsdom/DOM tests + sim):** zero adapters →
`NO WLAN ADAPTER DETECTED` + dongle hint, RESCAN in the join pane re-detects; one →
readonly `Name — Description · SSID · signal%`; several → picker (persisted choice
restored while present); saved missing → was "silently use first + small hint", now
disabled NOT DETECTED placeholder that blocks scan/join until re-chosen; listing
failure → `ADAPTER LIST FAILED` + reason; guide mode → was nothing, now the
Windows-app note + sim hint.

**Why the user likely never saw it:** any of (a) macOS dev machine without
`W17_WIFI_SIM` → guide mode, row hidden entirely (accepted likely cause — confirmed
in code); (b) `setupCompleted` persisted → boot skips PIT WALL; (c) DESKTOP FPV mode →
no PIT WALL step; (d) the Windows bench-host clone is at `dab3039`, which PREDATES the
adapter row entirely (row landed in the B-series ending `cf038c2`) — an old process /
old checkout shows no row on real Windows either. All four are consistent with the
reported experience; (a)+(d) are the most probable.

**Deterministic preview commands (any OS, from this repo, uncommitted tree):**
```
W17_WIFI_SIM=two-adapters npm start   # picker; join on Wi-Fi 2 leaves Wi-Fi on PaddockNet
W17_WIFI_SIM=one-adapter  npm start   # readonly single-adapter line
W17_WIFI_SIM=no-adapter   npm start   # NO WLAN ADAPTER DETECTED + hint
W17_WIFI_SIM=netsh-fail   npm start   # ADAPTER LIST FAILED + reason
npm start                             # macOS guide mode: Windows-app note + sim hint
```
Then GARAGE → IPHONE COCKPIT → PIT WALL (press CHANGE SETUP first if it boots straight
to GRID). Every screen shows the amber SIMULATED WIFI tag while the sim is active.
Host macOS/Linux interfaces are never presented as selectable adapters (guide mode has
no picker by design).

### Adapter-UI proposals (Q7 — pick one before any substantial redesign)

Current state after A3's objective fixes: correct and honest in every state, but
visually minimal — a text row above the tabs; the multi-adapter control is a bare
native `<select>`.

- **Option 1 — "Styled row" (minimal delta).** Keep the one-row layout; restyle the
  `<select>` (panel-edge border, custom teal chevron glyph, hover brightness, focus
  teal — focus already done) and give the readonly single-adapter span the same
  bordered treatment so one vs many adapters look related; NOT DETECTED stays a
  placeholder option. ~CSS-only + a chevron wrapper span; touches `hud.css`,
  `index.html` (one wrapper), no view-model change; tests unchanged (all states
  already pinned). Cheapest, but the single-adapter "card" remains one dense line.
- **Option 2 — "Adapter card" (recommended).** Promote the row to a small card in the
  netpane style: line 1 = interface name + state chip (CONNECTED ssid · signal% /
  DISCONNECTED / NOT DETECTED in amber), line 2 = driver description muted, line 3 =
  hint/troubleshooting. With 2+ adapters the card header becomes the opener of a
  netrow-style chooser list (`SELECT ADAPTER` / `CHANGE ADAPTER` button in minibtn
  style) — same interaction pattern the network list already trained the user on;
  zero adapters = the card body is the troubleshooting text + RESCAN. Touches
  `wifiView.mjs` (richer state object), `setupFlow.js` render, `index.html`,
  `hud.css`, `wifiView.test.js` + `setupFlowDom.test.js`. Clearest fit with Q7's
  "clearly styled selected-adapter card" wording while reusing existing visual
  vocabulary (netrow/minibtn/known-chip).
- **Option 3 — "Adapters as a list" (biggest change).** Render adapters exactly like
  the network list (one `netrow` per adapter, always visible, click to select, active
  row highlighted, signal right-aligned). Most discoverable and most consistent, but
  it permanently spends vertical space PIT WALL doesn't really have (network list +
  password row + tabs already stack), and a 1-adapter "list" looks odd.

Recommendation: **Option 2**. Objective fixes already landed regardless of choice
(guide-mode visibility, NOT DETECTED no-fallback, blocked unresolved scan/join,
select focus, honest error states, deterministic sim scenarios).

**DECISION (2026-07-12): Option 2 "Adapter card" — chosen and IMPLEMENTED.** The user
refined the spec: use a native `<select>` inside the card (not a custom popup) so
keyboard/screen-reader behavior is preserved; a single adapter is readonly with a clear
`SELECTED` indication and NO dropdown; multiple adapters show the selected adapter's
detail plus a bordered/chevron/hover/focus native dropdown labelled `SELECT ADAPTER`
(no valid selection) / `CHANGE ADAPTER` (one chosen), option labels carrying the driver
description; changing the selection updates the card immediately, persists, keeps
per-adapter connection state separate, and never silently falls back; a vanished saved
adapter shows amber `NOT DETECTED` and requires an explicit pick; zero adapters →
`NO WLAN ADAPTER DETECTED` + troubleshooting + `RESCAN`; a listing failure →
`ADAPTER CHECK FAILED` + sanitized reason + `RESCAN`; guide mode keeps the card with the
Windows-app note + `W17_WIFI_SIM` hint and never lists host interfaces as adapters; the
four sim scenarios are preserved and the two-adapter one demonstrates switching with
separate per-adapter state. Styling reuses `panel`/`netrow`/state-chip vocabulary
(teal connected/selected, amber warning/missing, notched corners); the card reads
interactive when a choice exists and readonly when it does not. See the "A3 adapter-card
follow-up" change-log entry and the transfer-checkpoint addendum for the file-by-file
detail and test results (full suite 331/331). Options 1 and 3 were not taken.

### A3 adapter-card follow-up status: COMPLETE (Q7 Option 2) — VISUALLY ACCEPTED in Electron

The ADAPTER row is now a compact card in the PIT WALL vocabulary. This touched only files
already modified by A1–A3, so the `git status --short` listing above is UNCHANGED (no new
tracked/untracked files). A full visual acceptance pass ran the real app in Electron across
all six states (see the "VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PASS" note below and the change-log). File by
file:

**`shared/wifiView.mjs`.** `adapterRowState(res, savedAdapter)` returns a CARD MODEL, not a
one-line label. Fields (present per mode): `mode` (guide/failed/missing/single/select);
`status`/`warn`/`rescan`/`hint` for the degraded headline states; `detail`
(`{name,description,connected,ssid,signalPct,chip:{text,tone}}`) for the adapter the card is
about; `selectedNote:'SELECTED'` for the single readonly adapter; `options`/`selected`/
`selectorLabel` (SELECT/CHANGE ADAPTER)/`savedMissing` for select mode. `ifaceChip` →
`{CONNECTED,connected}` / `{DISCONNECTED,idle}`; a vanished saved adapter gets a synthetic
`{NOT DETECTED,missing}` detail + amber. Failed-listing status text is now
**`ADAPTER CHECK FAILED`** and the reason is whitespace-collapsed + 160-char-capped
(`sanitizeReason`). Option labels reuse the full `ifaceLabel` (name — description · ssid ·
signal). NO field-mixing across adapters (each `detail` is one parsed block — the M2 rule).

**`renderer/index.html`.** `#adapterRow` is now `.adaptercard` with: `.adapterhead`
(`label` + `#adapterSelNote` SELECTED), `#adapterDetail` (`#adapterName` + `#adapterChip` +
`#adapterNet` + `#adapterDesc`), `#adapterPick` (`#adapterPickLabel` + `.selwrap` wrapping
the native `#adapterSelect`, `aria-label="WLAN adapter"` — visual-pass a11y fix, its only
programmatic name), `#adapterStatus`, `#adapterHint`, and a card-level `#adapterRescan`
minibtn. `#adapterSelect`/`#adapterHint`/`#adapterRow` ids preserved; the old `#adapterLabel`
span is gone.

**`renderer/setupFlow.js`.** `refreshAdapters()` caches the raw listing in `adapterRes`
(guide sentinel `{guide:true}` off-Windows) and calls `renderAdapterCard(adapterRowState(...))`.
`renderAdapterCard(state)` toggles the sub-blocks per mode and sets the left-accent class
(`interactive` teal = a choice exists; `warn` amber = missing/failed/saved-missing; neutral
= readonly single). The `<select>` change handler re-renders the card from the CACHED
listing (immediate header update, no extra netsh call), persists `network.adapter`, and
rescans pinned to the new iface. Degraded states show the card `#adapterRescan` and HIDE the
join-pane `#netRescan` (same `rescanAll` handler; avoids a duplicate button). `chosenAdapter()`
/`adapterUnresolved()` unchanged in contract (read `adapterSelect.value` + `adapterMode`).

**`renderer/hud.css`.** `.adaptercard` (panel bg, panel-edge border, 3px left accent,
notched corner; `width:min(46ch,80vw)` to match the netlist width so their right edges align
— visual-pass fix) + `.statechip` (idle muted / `.connected` teal / `.missing` amber) +
`.adapternet` (teal ssid·signal) + `.adapterdesc` (muted) + `.adapterpick` (a column: label
above, select below — visual-pass fix) / `.picklabel` + `.selwrap::after` custom teal chevron
(vertically centered) with `appearance:none` on the select; the select is `width:100%`,
ellipsizing within the card padding (visual-pass fix — it previously overflowed to the card's
right edge). Native keyboard/AX intact; hover brightness; focus = bright-teal border (from
A3, verified clearly visible in Electron). Old `.adapterrow` rules removed.

**NO change** to `main/wifiParse.js` / `main/wifiManager.js` / `main/wifiSim.js` — the A3
per-adapter sim + pinned status/join already back the card; the two-adapter sim demonstrates
switching with separate SSID/connection/signal per adapter.

**Tests.** `test/wifiView.test.js` 12→**14** (card-model shape for every mode; sanitized
reason). `test/setupFlowDom.test.js` 12→**14** (guide card / zero-adapter card + working
card RESCAN / single readonly card with chip+SSID+SELECTED+no-dropdown / saved-missing amber
NOT DETECTED blocking scan+join then pick→persist→re-pin→warn-cleared / two-adapter native
`<select>` pins scan+join and updates the card per-adapter). Native-`<select>` assertion
pins "keyboard/screen-reader preserved, not a custom popup" and now also asserts the select
carries an `aria-label` (visual-pass a11y fix). `noControlPath` untouched.

**Test commands + results (2026-07-12):**
- Syntax: `node --check renderer/setupFlow.js renderer/hud.js` + `wifiView.mjs` import — OK.
- Focused adapter/view/DOM: `npx vitest run test/wifiView.test.js test/setupFlowDom.test.js`
  → **28/28**.
- A1–A3 regression + guard: `npx vitest run test/hotspot.test.js test/runCommand.test.js
  test/keyboardFocus.test.js test/wifiParse.test.js test/wifiManager.test.js
  test/wifiSim.test.js test/noControlPath.test.js` → **110/110**.
- Full suite: `npm test` → **331/331, 27 files** (was 327; +2 wifiView, +2 setupFlowDom).
  `git diff --check` clean.

**VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PASS (2026-07-12, Electron, real app) — DONE.** Ran the real,
unmodified app (`main/main.js`, real preload + IPC + sim) in Electron across all six
states — `W17_WIFI_SIM=two-adapters|one-adapter|no-adapter|netsh-fail`, plain (guide), and a
seeded saved-missing (`network.adapter` = a name absent from the sim) — driving GARAGE →
IPHONE COCKPIT → PIT WALL and capturing a screenshot + a computed-style/DOM dump per state.
Findings: card layout, chip tones, SELECTED / CHANGE / SELECT ADAPTER labels, teal chevron,
amber NOT DETECTED, single-RESCAN degraded states (join-pane RESCAN correctly hidden), guide
note with a visually-secondary sim hint, per-adapter switching, and no page-level horizontal
overflow all render correctly. Focus verified clearly visible (bright-teal select border;
prominent RESCAN focus ring). Three small objective fixes applied and re-verified (see the
change-log "VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PASS" entry): (1) select `width:100%` in a column picker so it
ellipsizes with breathing room instead of overflowing the card edge; (2) card width matched
to the netlist (`min(46ch,80vw)`) so right edges align; (3) `aria-label` on the select for a
programmatic name. Nothing left pending here except the on-real-Windows bench eyeball with an
actual RT5370 (netsh block shape / localized text), which stays a §5 / D3-F bench item — the
sim preview is never bench evidence.

### Test results (B3 + B4, 2026-07-13)

- Syntax: `node --check` OK on all 29 changed JS/MJS files.
- Focused B3: `wifiParse` 39, `wifiManager` **36**, `wifiView` **35**, `wifiSim` 16,
  `setupFlowDom` **42** → **168/168** (incl. the `unknown`-security correction).
- Focused B4: `hostProbe` 16, `reachability` 7 → **23/23**.
- Regressions: A1/B1/B2 lifecycle (`hotspot`/`hotspotLifecycle`/`quitPolicy`/`runCommand`)
  **74/74**; A2 `keyboardFocus` **16/16**; `noControlPath` **10/10** (guard-list +1).
- Full suite `npm test` → **484/484 (31 files)** (was 407/29; +21 wifiParse, +11 wifiManager,
  +10 wifiView, +2 wifiSim, +11 setupFlowDom, +16 hostProbe, +7 reachability).
  `git diff --check` clean.
- Electron sim acceptance: all B3 rows/warnings/rejections + the OPEN password-field
  `display:none` (with JOIN still shown), and B4 reachable/timeout/unreachable wording,
  verified in the real app (scratchpad harness). Dev-preview only, never bench evidence.

### New finding this session

- **CSS `.hidden` no-op on `#netPassword`** (found + fixed in the B3 Electron pass): this
  stylesheet has no global `.hidden{display:none}`; hiding the open-network password input
  by class did nothing visually until `#netPassword.hidden{display:none}` was added. jsdom
  cannot see it (no linked-CSS/layout). No other bare-`.hidden`-on-an-unscoped-element cases
  were found in the B3/B4 diff, but it is worth a sweep in a later pass.

### Next batch (do NOT start until the user resumes)

1. ~~B3 (Wi-Fi security scope) + B4 (reachability classification)~~ — **DONE 2026-07-13**.
2. ~~Batch C — C1 video state / C2 replay chip / C3 env-locks / C5 W2-on-GRID docs (C4
   re-validated)~~ — **DONE 2026-07-13** (this batch; see the Batch C status section + change
   log). Stop-for-review is in effect; do NOT start Batch D until the user resumes.
3. ~~Batch D1 + D4~~ — **DONE 2026-07-13** (directory sweep + command-generation
   hardening; see the Batch D1 + D4 status section).
4. ~~Batch D2~~ — **DONE 2026-07-14** (main-process + setup-flow integration coverage,
   composition-root refactor onto `main/appWiring.js`; see the Batch D2 status section).
   **Stop-for-review is in effect: the D2 `main.js` refactor must be reviewed before D3
   begins.**
5. **Exact next starting point — Batch D3** (objective, NOT started): the Electron boot
   smoke + Windows CI step. The full scoped design (smokeMain wrapper + controller +
   controller-protocol vitest coverage + `npm run smoke` + windows-latest CI sequence)
   is written out in the "Exact D3 starting point" paragraph of the Batch D1 + D4
   status section above. NOTE (from the Batch C session): an offscreen Electron harness
   ran headless on macOS, so a hidden-window boot smoke is feasible locally too; the CI
   job stays windows-latest (the deployment target).
6. Then E1 (Q6 credential encryption — safeStorage/DPAPI, decision already logged), F (doc sync:
   L5 CURRENT_STATUS pointer + checklist prereqs + readiness-doc stale note; contract §1–§7
   untouched), G (proposals only).
7. Bench items accumulate in §5 + the per-batch bench notes; Batch C adds: real camera → mediamtx
   → WHEP so the video-state model runs against genuine WebRTC drops/stalls, and a real iPhone
   confirming W2 telemetry appears on GRID entry (C5). Nothing new is hardware-proven.

Recommended first actions for the next session: read this checkpoint + §4 decisions;
`git log --oneline -2` (expect HEAD **`79fa2e0`** "a lot of chagnes" on top of
`cf038c2`); `git status --short` (expect the **5-M** uncommitted D2-completion set above
— this audit file, `main/appWiring.js`, `main/main.js`, `test/appWiring.test.js`,
`test/ipcSurface.test.js` — plus the session-memory file if updated); `npm test` (expect
**610/610**, 36 files); `git diff --check` (clean).

### Hard boundaries (unchanged, apply always)

W3/5602 log-only; `noControlPath.test.js` green and strengthen-only; no pan/tilt or
camera-control mapping; no car-control path; no CRSF encoder; `docs/windows_bridge_contract.md`
§1–§7 untouched; canonical contract authority iPhone-side; viewer/setup/launcher only; sim
never counts as hardware evidence; persisted mode values stay compatible; no error
concealment; nothing committed/pushed without user review.
